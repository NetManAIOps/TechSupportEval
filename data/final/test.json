    "question": "How to configure SSL mutual authentication in IBM HTTP Server?\nWe are running IHS v7 and our application team has a specific webservice that they require SSL mutual authentication to be enabled for at the http server. Does anyone know how to set this up on IHS? Or any documentation?\n\nThanks",
    "ground_truth": "1. Confirm that the **Global Security Kit (GSKit)** is installed and meets the minimum requirements\n   \n2. Create a key database file and certificates needed to authenticate the Web server during an SSL handshake\n   \n3. Enable **SSL directives** within the IBM HTTP Server configuration file (httpd.conf)\n   \n4. Information that IBM WebSphere® Support needs to debug SSL configuration and certificate issues related to the IBM HTTP Server\n   ",
    "answer": "To configure SSL mutual authentication in IBM HTTP Server (IHS) v7, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Install Global Security Kit (GSKit)**: Ensure that GSKit is installed and meets the minimum requirements.\n\n2. **Create Key Database**: Create a key database file (KDB) and generate the necessary certificates for both the server and client authentication.\n\n3. **Edit Configuration File**:\n   - Open the `httpd.conf` file for your IHS installation.\n   - Ensure the SSL module is loaded by confirming the following line is uncommented:\n     ```\n     LoadModule ibm_ssl_module modules/mod_ibm_ssl.so\n     ```\n\n4. **Set Up SSL VirtualHost**:\n   - Add a `<VirtualHost>` block for SSL configuration. Here’s an example:\n     ```apache\n     <VirtualHost *:443>\n         SSLEnable\n         SSLDisable\n         KeyFile \"c:/program files/ibm http server/key.kdb\"\n         SSLServerCert \"your_server_cert\"\n         SSLClientAuth on\n         SSLVerifyClient require\n         SSLVerifyDepth 2\n         # Additional SSL settings as needed\n     </VirtualHost>\n     ```\n\n5. **Client Certificate Configuration**: Ensure that the client certificates are properly configured and trusted by the server.\n\n6. **Restart IHS**: After making these changes, restart the IBM HTTP Server to apply the new configuration.\n\nFor detailed documentation, refer to the IBM Knowledge Center for your specific version of IHS, as it may contain additional configuration options and troubleshooting tips.",

    "question": "Netcool/Impact (all versions): How is the Exit() action function expected to work with User Defined Functions?\nNetcool/Impact (all versions)\n\nUsing the Exit() action function within a User Defined Function in a Policy will not exit the Policy process.",
    "ground_truth": "1. Set a variable that is then tested immediately after the **User Defined Function call**.",
    "answer": "The Exit() action function within a User Defined Function (UDF) in Netcool/Impact does not exit the entire Policy process; it only exits the UDF itself. To effectively exit the Policy process from within a UDF, you need to set a global variable that indicates the exit condition and then check that variable immediately after the UDF call.\n\nHere’s how you can implement this:\n\n1. Inside your User Defined Function, set a global variable to indicate that you want to exit the Policy:\n   ```ipl\n   SetGlobalVar(\"ExitNow\", 1);\n   Exit();\n   ```\n\n2. After calling the User Defined Function, check the global variable and exit the Policy if needed:\n   ```ipl\n   If(GetGlobalVar(\"ExitNow\") == 1) {\n       Log(ID+WP+\": Exiting policy...\");\n       Exit();\n   }\n   ```\n\nThis approach allows you to control the flow of your Policy based on conditions set within your UDF.",
