This document covers information on setting up SSL virtualhosts, creating keyfiles, certificates along with how to protect access to directories and URLs to specific ciphers. Also, included is documentation on how to trace and record SSL traffic between a client browser and the Web server. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe following steps help guide you through the proper set up of SSL within the IBM HTTP Server: \n\n 1. Confirm that the Global Security Kit (GSKit) is installed and meets the minimum requirements\n    \n    \n 2. Create a key database file and certificates needed to authenticate the Web server during an SSL handshake\n    \n    \n 3.

Information that IBM WebSphere® Support needs to debug SSL configuration and certificate issues related to the IBM HTTP Server\n\n\n\n\n\n\n 1. Confirm that the Global Security Kit is installed and meets the minimum requirements\n    \n    The Global Security Kit (GSKit) is a required component for the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) enablement within the IBM HTTP Server. Therefore, it is important to confirm that a supported version of the Global Security Kit is installed prior to enabling SSL.\n    \n    For a complete listing of IBM HTTP Server releases and corresponding Global Security Kit versions, click IBM HTTP Server: Global Security Kit (GSKit) supported versions [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=177&context=SSEQTJ&uid=swg21173214].\n    \n    \n    \n 2. Create a key database file and certificates needed to authenticate the Web server during an SSL handshake\n    \n    The iKeyman GUI, which is included within the IBM HTTP Server distribution, can be used to create a key database file (for example: key.kdb) needed to store personal server certificates required by the client browser during an SSL handshake.\n    \n    For quick information on how to create a key database file and personal server certificates, refer to the technote IKEYMAN, How do I...?

Both hostnames must be registered in DNS to a separate IP address, and both IP addresses must be configured on local network interface cards.\n        \n        http:\/\/www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 http:\/\/www.mycompany2.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.103 https:\/\/www.mycompany2.com (SSL) 192.168.1.103\n        \n        Example 2:\n        \n        Listen 80\n        ServerName www.mycompany.com\n        \n        <Directory \"c:\/Program Files\/IBM HTTP Server\/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        <\/Directory>\n        \n        DocumentRoot \"c:\/program files\/ibm http server\/htdocs\"\n        DirectoryIndex index.html\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:80>\n        ServerName www.mycompany2.com\n        <Directory \"c:\/Program Files\/IBM HTTP Server\/htdocs2\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        <\/Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:\/program files\/ibm http server\/htdocs2\"\n        DirectoryIndex index2.html\n        <\/VirtualHost>\n        \n        Listen 443\n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:443>\n        ServerName www.mycompany2.com\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        <Directory \"c:\/Program Files\/IBM HTTP Server\/htdocs2\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        <\/Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:\/program files\/ibm http server\/htdocs2\"\n        DirectoryIndex index2.html\n        <\/VirtualHost>\n        \n        SSLDisable\n        KeyFile \"c:\/program files\/ibm http server\/key.kdb\"\n        SSLV2Timeout 100\n        SSLV3Timeout 1000 \n        If you are enabling multiple Web sites for SSL, you can enable SSL as follows. All hostnames must be registered in DNS to a separate IP address. Also, all the IP addresses must be configured on a local network interface card. You must use the SSLServerCert directive to identify which personal server certificate in the key database file is passed to the client browser during the SSL handshake for each Web site. If the SSLServerCert directive is not defined, the IBM HTTP Server passes whatever certificate in the key database file is marked(*) as the \"default key\".\n        \n        For more information on why different IP addresses are required when enabling multiple Web sites for SSL: IP-Based Virtual Hosting must be used if configuring multiple SSL Virtual Host [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=177&context=SSEQTJ&uid=swg21045922]http:\/\/www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 https:\/\/www.mycompany.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.102 http:\/\/www.mycompany2.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.103 https:\/\/www.mycompany2.com (SSL) 192.168.1.103 http:\/\/www.mycompany3.com (non-SSL) 192.168.1.104 https:\/\/www.mycompany3.com (SSL) 192.168.1.104\n        \n        Example 3:\n        \n        Listen 80\n        ServerName www.mycompany.com\n        \n        <Directory \"c:\/Program Files\/IBM HTTP Server\/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        <\/Directory>\n        \n        DocumentRoot \"c:\/program files\/ibm http server\/htdocs\"\n        DirectoryIndex index.html\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:80>\n        ServerName www.mycompany2.com\n        <Directory \"c:\/Program Files\/IBM HTTP Server\/htdocs2\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        <\/Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:\/program files\/ibm http server\/htdocs2\"\n        DirectoryIndex index2.html\n        <\/VirtualHost>\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.104:80>\n        ServerName www.mycompany3.com\n        <Directory \"c:\/Program Files\/IBM HTTP Server\/htdocs3\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        <\/Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:\/program files\/ibm http server\/htdocs3\"\n        DirectoryIndex index3.html\n        <\/VirtualHost>\n        \n        Listen 443\n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.102:443>\n        ServerName www.mycompany.com\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        SSLServerCert mycompany\n        <Directory \"c:\/Program Files\/IBM HTTP Server\/htdocs\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        <\/Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:\/program files\/ibm http server\/htdocs\"\n        DirectoryIndex index.html\n        <\/VirtualHost>\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.103:443>\n        ServerName www.mycompany2.com\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        SSLServerCert mycompany2\n        <Directory \"c:\/Program Files\/IBM HTTP Server\/htdocs2\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        <\/Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:\/program files\/ibm http server\/htdocs2\"\n        DirectoryIndex index2.html\n        <\/VirtualHost>\n        \n        <VirtualHost 192.168.1.104:443>\n        ServerName www.mycompany3.com\n        SSLEnable\n        SSLClientAuth None\n        SSLServerCert mycompany3\n        <Directory \"c:\/Program Files\/IBM HTTP Server\/htdocs3\">\n        Options Indexes\n        AllowOverride None\n        order allow,deny\n        allow from all\n        <\/Directory>\n        DocumentRoot \"c:\/program files\/ibm http server\/htdocs3\"\n        DirectoryIndex index3.html\n        <\/VirtualHost>\n        \n        SSLDisable\n        KeyFile \"c:\/program files\/ibm http server\/key.kdb\"\n        SSLV2Timeout 100\n        SSLV3Timeout 1000 \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 4.

    "reference_doc": "IBM 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED Connecting to WebSphere MQ from WebSphere Application Server via CLIENT Bindings - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n This article covers the most common reasons why an application running in WebSphere Application Server receives a 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED error when connecting to MQ as a client over a network. Quick steps to work around the MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED errors during development are provided in the 'Resolving the problem' section, as well as considerations for implementing security in production environments. A summary is also provided of behavior for outbound scenarios with container-managed and component-managed security, as well as inbound behavior for listener ports and activiation specifications \n\nSYMPTOM\nJMSCMQ0001: WebSphere MQ call failed with compcode '2' ('MQCC_FAILED') reason '2035' ('MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED')\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe two most likely reasons why the connection is refused by MQ are as follows: \n\n 1. The user identifier passed across the client connection from the application server to MQ is not known on the server where the MQ queue manager is running, is not authorised to connect to MQ, or is longer than 12 characters and has been truncated.\n    We discuss how this user identifier is obtained and passed over the connection in more detail below.\n    For queue managers running on Windows, the following error might be seen in the MQ error logs for this scenario:\n    AMQ8075: Authorization failed because the SID for entity 'wasuser' cannot be obtained.\n    For UNIX no entry in the MQ error logs would be seen by default.\n    See technote MQS_REPORT_NOAUTH environment variable can be used to better diagnose return code 2035 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=171&uid=swg21299319] for details of enabling error log entries on all platforms. \n 2. The user identifier passed across the client connection from the application server to MQ is a member of the 'mqm' group on the server hosting the MQ queue manager, and a Channel Authentication Record (CHLAUTH) exists that blocks administrative access to the queue manager. WebSphere MQ configures a CHLAUTH record by default in WebSphere MQ Version 7.1 and later that blocks all MQ admins from connecting as a client to the queue manager.\n    The following error in the MQ error logs would be seen for this scenario:\n    AMQ9777: Channel was blocked\n\nSee the Error logs on Windows, UNIX and Linux systems [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r5\/topic\/com.ibm.mq.tro.doc\/q039560_.htm] section of the MQ Information Center for the location of the MQ error logs. \nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nTo understand the cause of the MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED reason code, you need to understand what username (and password) is being used by MQ to authorise the application server. \n\nPlease note that WebSphere MQ V7.5 and earlier does not provide any out-of-the box password authentication system for client connections.\nPassword authentication is provided out of the box in IBM MQ V8.0. More details on the new IBM MQ V8.0 security features are available in this presentation [https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/MoragHughson\/websphere-mq-v8-security-deep-dive]. \n\nFor WebSphere MQ V7.5 and earlier, this means that while the understanding provided in this technote over how usernames\/passwords are passed from the application server to MQ is helpful for development environments, solving the security requirements of production environments usually also requires one of the following approaches: \n\n * Mutual SSL\/TLS authentication.\n   MQ provides out-of-the-box features to authenticate a remotely attaching client using the digital certificate they provide for SSL\/TLS transport security. For example by configuring an SSLPEER rule on the SVRCONN channel to match the Distinguished Name in the certificate of the WebSphere Application Server, and establishing trust in the issuer of that certificate. \n * A custom, or 3rd party supplied, WebSphere MQ Security Exit\n   A security exit can be written for MQ that performs username and password authentication against a repository, such as the local operating system on the MQ server, or an LDAP repository.\n   When using a security exit for authentication it is important that SSL\/TLS transport security is still configured, to ensure passwords are not sent in plain text.\n\n\nMCA user ID (MCAUSER) configured on the Server Connection (SVRCONN) channel If an MCAUSER is configured on the SVRCONN channel that the application server is using to connect, and no security exit or mapping Channel Authentication Record is installed, then this overrides the username provided by the application server. \n\nIt is common practice for many customers to set an MCAUSER on every SVRCONN channel, and use mutual SSL\/TLS authentication exclusively for authentication. \n\nDefault behaviour when no credentials are supplied in the application server \n\nIf no credentials are supplied by the application on the createConnection call, and neither of the component managed or container managed security systems described below are configured, then WebSphere Application Server provides a blank username to MQ. This causes MQ to authorise the client based on the userid that the MQ listener is running under. In the majority of cases this is 'mqm' on UNIX\/Linux systems and 'MUSR_MQADMIN' on Windows. \n\nAs these are administrative MQ users, they will be blocked by default in WebSphere MQ V7.1 and higher, with a AMQ9777 error logged in the error logs of the queue manager. \n\nContainer-managed security for outbound connections \n\nThe recommended way to configure the username and password passed to MQ by the application server for outbound connections, is to use container-managed security. Outbound connections are those created using a Connection Factory, rather than a Listener Port or Activation Specification. \n\nUsernames of 12 characters or less are passed to MQ by the appliaction server. Usernames longer than 12 characters in length will be truncated, either during authorisation (on UNIX), or in the MQMD of messages that are sent. \n\nContainer-managed security means that the deployment descriptor, or EJB 3.0 annotations, of the application declare a resource reference with authentication type set to Container. \n\nThen when the application looks up the Connection Factory in JNDI, it does so indirectly via the resource reference. For example an EJB 2.1 application would perform a JNDI lookup as follows, where \"jms\/MyResourceRef\" has been declared as a resource reference in the deployment descriptor: \n\nConnectionFactory myCF = (ConnectionFactory)ctx.lookup(\"java:comp\/env\/jms\/MyResourceRef\") \n\nAn EJB 3.0 application might declare an annotated object property on the bean as follows:\n@Resource(name = \"jms\/MyResourceRef\", \nauthenticationType = AuthenticationType.CONTAINER)\nprivate javax.jms.ConnectionFactory myCF; \n\nWhen the application is deployed by an administrator, they bind this authentication alias to an actual Connection Factory that has been created in JNDI, and assign it a J2C authentication alias on deployment. \n\nIt is the username and password contained in this authentication alias that is then passed to MQ\/JMS by the application server when the application connects. This approach puts the administrator in control of which username and password is used by each application, and prevents a different application from looking up the connection factory in JNDI directly to connect with the same username and password. \n\nA default container-managed authentication alias can be supplied on the configuration panels in the administrative console for MQ connection factories. This default will only be used in the case that an application uses a resource reference configured for container-managed security, but the administrator has not bound it to an authentication alias during deployment. A screen shot is provided below:\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21636093&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21636093&aid=1] \n\nDefault component-managed authentication alias for outbound connections \n\nFor cases where it is impractical to change the application to use container-managed security, or to change it to supply a username and password directly on the createConnection call, it is possible to supply a default. \n\nThis default is called the \"component-managed authentication alias\" and cannot be configured via the administrative console (since WebSphere Application Server Version 7.0 when it was removed from the panels MQ connection factories). The below scripting samples show how to configure it using wsadmin: \n\n * JACL:\n   wsadmin>set cell [ $AdminConfig getid \"\/Cell:mycell\" ]\n   \n   mycell(cells\/mycell|cell.xml#Cell_1)\n   \n   wsadmin>$AdminTask listWMQConnectionFactories $cell\n   \n   MyCF(cells\/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)\n   \n   wsadmin>$AdminTask modifyWMQConnectionFactory MyCF(cells\/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104) { -componentAuthAlias myalias }\n   \n   MyCF(cells\/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104) \n * Jython:\n   wsadmin>cell = AdminConfig.getid(\"\/Cell:mycell\")\n   \n   wsadmin>AdminTask.listWMQConnectionFactories(cell)\n   \n   'MyCF(cells\/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)'\n   \n   wsadmin>AdminTask.modifyWMQConnectionFactory('MyCF(cells\/mycell|resos urces.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)', \"-componentAuthAlias myalias\")\n   \n   'MyCF(cells\/mycell|resources.xml#MQConnectionFactory_1247500675104)'\n\n\nAuthentication alias for inbound MDB connections using an activation specification For inbound connections using an activation specification an authentication alias can be specified by the administrator when deploying the application, or a default authentication alias can be specified on the activation specification via the administrative console. \n\nAuthentication alias for inbound MDB connections using a listener port \n\nFor inbound connections using a listener port, the value specified in the \"Container-managed authentication alias\" setting of the connection factory (seen in the above screenshot) is used. \n\nOn zOS, first the \"Container-managed authentication alias\" is checked and used if set, then the \"Component-managed authentication alias\" is checked and used it set.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe simplest steps to resolve the 2035 MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED errors in a development environment, where full transport security is not required, are as follows: \n\n 1. Choose a user that you want WebSphere Application Server to be authenticated as. Typically the user chosen should have authority relevant to the context of the operations required by the application running in WebSphere Application Server and no more. For example, 'mqm' or other super user is not appropriate. \n 2. If this user is an MQ administrative user, then relax the Channel Authentication Record (CHLAUTH) security in MQ V7.1 or higher, so that administrative connections are not blocked on the SVRCONN channel you wish to use. An example MQSC command to do this for a SVRCONN channel called 'WAS.CLIENTS' is provided as follows:\n    SET CHLAUTH('WAS.CLIENTS') TYPE(BLOCKUSER) USERLIST(ALLOWANY) \n 3. Configure the SVRCONN channel to set the MCA user ID (MCAUSER) to the user you have chosen. An example MQSC command to configure a SVRCONN channel to use 'myuser' as the MCA user ID is provided as follows:\n    ALTER CHL('WAS.CLIENTS') CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) MCAUSER('myuser')\n\n\nThe following additional considerations are important for production environments: For all production environments where transport security is required, SSL\/TLS security must be configured between the application server and MQ. \n\nIn order to configure SSL\/TLS transport security, you must establish the appropriate trust between the MQ queue manager and WebSphere Application Server. The application server, who initiates the SSL\/TLS handshake, must always be configured to trust the certificate provided by the MQ queue manager . If the application server is configured to send a certificate to the MQ queue manager, then the queue manager must also be configured to trust it. \n\nIf trust is not correctly configured on both sides, you will encounter 2393 MQRC_SSL_INITIALIZATION_ERROR reason codes after enabling SSL\/TLS on the connection. \n\nIf you do not have a security exit that performs username and password authentication, then you should configure mutual SSL\/TLS authentication on your Server Connection channel to cause the queue manager to require a trusted certificate is provided by the application server. To do this you set \"SSL Authentication\" to \"Required\" in the MQ Explorer or SSLCAUTH(REQUIRED) via MQSC. \n\nIf you do have a security exit that performs username and password authentication installed in your MQ server, then configure your application to supply a username and password for validation by that security exit. The details of how to configure the username and password passed to MQ by the application server are described above in the \"Diagnosing the problem\" section. \n\nAll Server Connection channels that do not have SSL\/TLS security applied should be disabled. Example MQSC commands to disable the SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN channel are provided as follows (these assume no user exists on the MQ server called 'NOAUTH'):\nALTER CHL(SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN) CHLTYPE(SVRCONN) MCAUSER('NOAUTH')\nSTOP CHL(SYSTEM.DEF.SVRCONN) \n\nDetails of how to configure the private certificate and trust of a MQ queue manager, and to enable SSL security on a Server Connection channel, see the following locations in the MQ information center: \n\n * To configure the certificates and trust of the MQ queue manager see the following topic:\n   Configuring SSL on queue managers [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r1\/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.explorer.doc%2Fe_ssl_channels.htm] \n * To configure the Server Connection channel, used by applications running in the application server to connect to MQ, see the following topic:\n   Configuring SSL channels [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r1\/topic\/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc\/e_ssl_channels.htm]\n\n\nDetails of how you configure trust within WebSphere Application Server, and whether the application server sends a certificate to MQ for authentication, are in the following locations in the WebSphere Application Server information center:  * To create or modify an SSL Configuration containing the appropriate SSL\/TLS configuration for connecting to MQ, see the following topic:\n   SSL configurations [http:\/\/www14.software.ibm.com\/webapp\/wsbroker\/redirect?version=phil&product=was-base-dist&topic=csec_sslconfigs]\n   Note that MQ requires you specify a matching Cipher Suite \/ Cipher Spec on both sides of the connection, as it checks the negotiated Cipher Suite matches the SSLCIPH setting on the channel after the handshake is complete. As a result the WebSphere Application Server SSL Configuration should be configured to contain only the Cipher Suite that matches the SSLCIPH setting on the Server Connection channel. See the following topic in the MQ information center for details of matching pairs:\n   CipherSuite and CipherSpec name mappings for connections to a WebSphere® MQ queue manager [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r1\/topic\/com.ibm.mq.msc.doc\/xms_csecure_mapping_wmq.html] \n * To enable SSL\/TLS on a client connection, and choose which SSL Configuration to use, see the \"Use SSL to secure communication with Websphere MQ\", \"Centrally managed\" and \"Specific configuration\" sections of the following topics on Connection Factories and Activation Specifications\n   WebSphere MQ messaging provider connection factory settings [http:\/\/www14.software.ibm.com\/webapp\/wsbroker\/redirect?version=phil&product=was-nd-dist&topic=umj_pjcfm]\n   WebSphere MQ messaging provider activation specification settings [http:\/\/www14.software.ibm.com\/webapp\/wsbroker\/redirect?version=phil&product=was-nd-dist&topic=umj_pasm]\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers WebSphere Application Server for z\/OS Java Messaging Service (JMS) z\/OS, OS\/390 8.5, 8.0, 7.0 Business Integration WebSphere Business Monitor AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows, z\/OS 7.5.1, 7.5, 7.0 Advanced, Basic Business Integration WebSphere Message Broker Environment AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows, z\/OS 9.0, 8.0, 7.0 Business Integration WebSphere MQ Clients AIX, HP-UX, IBM i, Linux, Windows 8.0, 7.5, 7.1, 7.0",

    "reference_doc": "IBM Insufficient ulimit Value Causes Native OutOfMemory - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n An out of memory may be observed on a system running WebSphere Application Server on Linux or AIX that is due to ulimit restrictions on number of process\/threads per user. Further investigation may reveal a \"Failed to create a thread:\" message within the generated javacore which would indicate a native out of memory issue has been encountered. The cause of the problem may be an insufficient ulimit setting. While this type of issue can occur on any level of Linux, or AIX, the issue is most likely to be seen in systems running multiple instances of WebSphere Application Server using one userid. The following will outline how to identify if a process ulimit is the culprit and what WebSphere Application Server Support recommends to fix the case. \n\nSYMPTOM\nAn out of memory Dump Event such as: \n\n\"systhrow\" (00040000) Detail \"java\/lang\/OutOfMemoryError\"\n\"Failed to create a thread: retVal -1073741830, errno 11\" received\n\nNote: This detailed message will appear only in javacores.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nWhen using WebSphere Application Server, ulimits can be set to fix or tune around a number of problems. For more on how to set a ulimit refer to the \"Guidelines for setting ulimits [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413]\" Technote which goes into detail on setting different ulimits on various operating systems and the difference between the soft and hard limit. This article is concerned particularly with the \"-u\" ulimit or \"nproc\" limit on Linux, the ulimit - r on AIX which affects the number of threads allowed for a single user process running WebSphere Application Server. \n\nThe AIX issue is less commonly seen as it limits then number of threads for a process but is seen in application servers with very large thread pools, This is becoming more common in 64bit addressing JVMs running complex applications. WebSphere Application support recommends setting the ulimit -r ulimited on AIX.\n\nThe nproc limit usually only counts processes on a server towards determining this number. Linux systems running WebSphere Application Server are a particular case. The nproc limit on Linux counts the number of threads within all processes that can exist for a given user. To determine the ulimit settings of a WebSphere Application Server process running on Linux refer to \"How to determine the ulimit settings of a running WebSphere Application Server process on Linux [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21407889]\".\n\nUser Limits (in bytes except for NOFILE and NPROC) \n\ntype soft limit hard limit RLIMIT_AS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CORE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_CPU unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_DATA unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_FSIZE unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_LOCKS unlimited unlimited RLIMIT_MEMLOCK 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NOFILE 65536 65536 RLIMIT_NPROC 131072 131072 \n\nFor most cases of older versions of Linux this value will be defaulted to around 2048. For out of the box Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 the default value for nproc will be set to 1024. This low default setting for larger systems will not allow for enough threads in all processes. \n\nWebSphere Application Server Support recommends setting the ulimit -u or nproc to a value of 131072 when running on Linux to safely account for all the forked threads within processes that could be created. \n\nBy using this recommended value a sufficient number of threads in all processes will be allowed and will not be a limiting factor for the environment. Increasing the limit to the suggested value should have no negative impact. When the number of threads in all processes reaches the -u ulimit, an out of memory error message will be thrown. This issue can be avoided by increasing this limit. Be aware that if the number of threads\/processes reaches the recommended number of 131072 or close, the issue may be deeper and continuing to increase the -u ulimit will only prove to be a temporary fix. \n\nOnce the ulimit is increased, the WebSphere Application Server will need to be restarted to use the \nnew setting. In the case of WebSphere Application Server ND, the nodeagent and the servers on the nodes will need to be restarted.",

Unix Error Code 24. \n * Truncated Core Dumps \/ Heap Dumps\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\nIs it possible to display the current ulimit settings? The command ulimit -Xa will display all current settings that are set for the current login session, where X represents the hard (H) or soft (S) limits to be displayed. By default, if no value is supplied for X, soft limits will be displayed. However if a process is already running, it may have a different ulimit configurations than the current shell that you run the ulimit -a command in.\n\n\n\n\nHow are ulimts set? Soft vs. Hard limits Soft limits are the current setting for a particular limit. They can be increased only to the current hard limit setting. \n\nHard limits are the maximum limit that can be configured. Any changes to these require root access. \n\n \n\nTemporary Settings (for current session) \n\n * \n * ulimit -[H|S]limit_name limit_value\n\n\nTemporary settings are set via the command line using the ulimit command. The limit_name must be present in the command (see the chart below). These settings are only temporary for the current session and will be lost once the session is over or the terminal window is closed. \n\nThis syntax can be used within shell scripts. Any processes spawned from these shell scripts will also have the temporary settings for the lifetime they are running. \n\nBy default, the soft limit will be changed (as changing the hard limit needs root access). Use -H (for hard limits) or -S (for soft limits) to change specific hard or soft limits. \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn HP-UX, if you receive an error when setting a particular limit, and you have altered that particular hard limit, you may need to check and see if it had exceeded the kernel parameters. You can use kctune to check (and alter) these if necessary; check your HP-UX documentation for more information. \n\nFor Solaris, settings in the \"\/etc\/system\" configuration file also allow configuring of some kernel-wide limits. \n\n \n\nGlobal Settings \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=1] Any changes to these global configuration limits files should be performed by your system administrator. Instructions on how to edit the files can be found on the manpage or in the commented section of the configuration file, as they can vary between versions of UNIX or Linux. \n\n \n\nThe format of the file, which differs slightly on versions of AIX and Linux, allows individual limits per users or groups, as well as set hard and soft limits. The limits defined in this configuration file are set globally. \n\n \n\nChanges made to any limits file take effect after launching a new login shell (such as bash -l), or if the user logs out and logs back in to the system. \n\n \n\nNOTES: \n\nOn Solaris and HP-UX, changes made to your shell's profile configuration (.profile or .login) should also take effect on the next login shell launched, or when your user logs back in using the specific shell. \n\nFor kernel-wide settings, which usually require a restart of the operating system to take effect, HP-UX has the kctune command, while Solaris has the \/etc\/system configuration file. \n\n \n\nSpecifics for each Operating System:\nThe most up-to-date information on the limits can be found in the man page for \"ulimit\".\n\n\n\nAIX \nGlobal settings are generally set in the file \/etc\/security\/limits, although there may be different limit files for LPARs and WPARs. \n\n \n\nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions.

Instead, you would need to issue the specific ulimit command in your shell's (or user's) profile configuration (like .profile or .login). \n\nAlso depending on the shell used, the ulimit command is slightly different. See the man page for further information. \n\nYou can also set kernel wide settings for many of these ulimits in the \/etc\/system file. \nFor example, \"set lim_fd_max = [value]\" and \"set rlim_fd_cur = [value]\" are respectively the global hard and soft file descriptor limits. See the system OS's documentation for information on the \/etc\/system file. \nPlease note that this table may not represent all ulimit items as they can vary between operating system versions.

However these settings won't take effect until you restart your application server (and nodeagent), making sure you restart on the same command line where you executed \"ulimit -n\". \n\nHowever, if you increase the value high enough and still run into these errors, you may want to check for a file descriptor leak (meaning a leak of opened files and\/or sockets in your application code). The command lsof, offered on a variety of operating systems, can provide information on the quantity and types of file descriptors in use. \n\nFurther information can be found at this link: Too Many Open Files error message [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352] \n\n\nOn Linux, can I set the ulimit for the number of open files to unlimited? Certain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux do not allow this value to be set to unlimited due to a known issue in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 [https:\/\/bugzilla.redhat.com\/show_bug.cgi?id=507159]. The limit must be set to an integer value no larger than 1048576. Other versions of Linux may not have this restriction. In the Information Center for WebSphere Application Server, there is a recommendation [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/en\/SSAW57_8.0.0\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/info\/ae\/ae\/tprf_tunelinux.html] of 8000. \n\nIf an attempt is made to set this ulimit to unlimited via the command line, an error will be displayed, and the old value will remain in place:\n[root] # ulimit -n unlimited\nbash: ulimit: open files: cannot modify limit: Operation not permitted\n\n\n \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21469413&amp;aid=2] If you try to edit the \/etc\/security\/limits.conf file to force unlimited for the number of open files, this will still be considered invalid and it will be reset to 0. This will prevent any new processes from spawning by that user or group. If this is the root user, the system will slowly die as new processes will be unable to generate. A recovery disc will be needed to reset the value. \n\n\n\n\nOn Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, why are my settings for nproc (ulimit -u) not being honored. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 has introduced a configuration file, addressed in a bug report [https:\/\/bugzilla.redhat.com\/show_bug.cgi?id=919793], ( \/etc\/security\/limits.d\/90-nproc.conf ) that overrides the nproc setting in the limits.conf. This file contains a line for nproc configured with a soft limit of 1024. \n\n* soft nproc 1024 \n\nThe rationale for this was to prevent fork bombs from occurring, To keep using the limits.conf for your nproc ulimit settings, you would need to comment this line out by making the first character on the line a hash\/pound symbol. \n\n#* soft nproc 1024 \n \n\nI am using an \/etc\/init.d script (or inittab) to start my application server and setting the global ulimit settings had no effect? The global settings for ulimit will not take effect if the init process starts the application server or nodeagent because it has yet to load the global settings. The global settings take effect once a login terminal session is started, or when a user logs in to the system, not when the init process spawns new processes based on init.d scripts. At startup, the operating system hasn't begun to load specific profiles up, even the root user. When you see individual services and processes starting, these are all child processes of the init process \n\nThis was previously documented for AIX 6.1 in the following Knowledge Center article entitled \"telinit or init Command\", under the Environments section. Here's the quoted section: \n\n\"A command that is executed by init from the \/etc\/inittab file uses init's ulimit values and not the default values as given in \/etc\/security\/limits. The result is that a command that is successfully executed from the command line may not execute correctly when invoked by init. Any command that has specific ulimit requirements should include specific actions to set the ulimit values as required.\"\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Domino for Linux (see step 2) [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21377724]\nAIX - IBM SDK 7.0 User Guide - Ulimits [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/java7sdk\/v7r0\/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.aix.70.doc%2Fuser%2Fulimits.html]\nLinux - IBM SDK 7.0 User Guide - Ulimits [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/java7sdk\/v7r0\/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.java.lnx.70.doc%2Fuser%2Fulimits.html]",

When a user logs into the IBM Cognos BI application with a user name and password, the trusted credential used to run schedules when not logged in will be refreshed as well. This removes the burden from the end user of having to remember to manually refresh their trusted credentials and may eliminate failed activities caused by changed or expired user credentials.\nThe credential refresh behaviour is controlled by the Security > Authentication > Automatically renew trusted credential setting in Cognos Configuration.\n\n\n * Primary namespace only (default setting): When you log on to the first namespace of your session, if you have trusted credentials for that account, the credentials are updated for the primary account only. All other credentials for other namespaces are not updated.\n   \n * Off: Credentials are not updated in any namespace.\n   \n * All namespaces: When you log on to the first namespace, your credentials are updated as described for \"Primary namespace only\". When you log on to additional namespaces, if your trusted credentials associated with the primary account contain logon information for that namespace, then those trusted credentials are updated. NOTE: Do not use the All namespaces option if users authenticate into secondary namespaces as different users.\n\n\nA user's trusted credentials for a namespace will only be renewed once per day. \n\nIt is NOT possible to use SSO with the feature 'Automatically Renew Trusted Credentials' found in Cognos BI. The reason for this is due to the following: \n\n\"A trusted credential is special because the namespace credentials it stores must be usable at any time, not depending on any timestamp. This rules out SSO tickets like Kerberos tokens or SAP tokens as they will expire after a short time and will become unusable. A suitable trusted credential therefore usually is a pair consisting of a user name and a password. However, for SSO based authentication to IBM Cognos BI, there is no password available to the namespace that can be stored into the trusted credential. Therefore, this feature will only work for basic authentication, when the user provides a user name and password to the login screen.\" RELATED INFORMATION\n Proven Practices: Securing the IBM Cognos 10 BI Environ [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/data\/library\/cognos\/security\/cognos_bi_platform\/page602.html]\nCognos Analytics 11 Equivalent Technote [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21998776]",

This document describes how to roll back an installed Fix Pack or Interim Fix applied to Cognos BI. \n\nANSWER\nAssuming create backup was selected, there will be a folder with the backup under the uninstall directory. Use these files to roll back. In version 10.2.1 FP1 and above there is no option to create a backup, instead backups are automatically created in the <cognos_install>\/bkp directory.\nNote that the backup directories only contain copies of all individual files that were modified by the fix pack or interim fix, not the entire contents of the original directory.\n\nCare must also be taken when removing interim fixes to ensure that there weren't later interim fixes applied which also contain some of the same files. It is recommended that a full system and content store backup be performed before attempting.\n\nSteps: \n\n\n\n 1. Stop the Cognos service and ensure that Cognos Configuration is not running. \n 2. When setting up the configuration of a newly installed Cognos BI environment, it is important to note that if you configure the new installation against the original content store, it is permanently upgraded to the new version and can no longer be used in the original environment. As a result, always create a backup of the content store prior to upgrading.\n    If a roll back to the original version is required, you can simply restore the backup. However, any work done after the content store has been upgraded (reports, models, security, etc...) to the new version will be lost, as all of this information is saved in the content store.\n    If you try to revert back to an earlier environment configured against the upgraded content store, you will get an error similar to the one below:\n    CM-CFG-5027 Unable to upgrade the content store to the to the version N that is compatible with this version of Content Manager.

I am using a 64bit JVM and I clearly have plenty of memory left. How can I resolve this problem?\" \n\nCAUSE\n \n\n*In this note, please refer to Java Versioning: Java Version.Release.ServiceRelease.FixPack \nex: Java 7.1.4.6 is the same as Java 7.1 SR4 FP6 is the same as Java 7 R1 SR4 FP6. \nThe IBM JVM will automatically use compressed references [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/understanding\/mm_compressed_references.html]when using a maximum heap size less than 25GB. This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z\/OS) \n\nSee Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. \n\n\"When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor\/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode. Because we are using 32 bits to store the location of these, and they are located in native (non-Java heap) memory, they must be allocated in the first 4GB of the address space - the maximum range we can address with the 32 bits.\" ~IBM Java Development Team \n\nIf the Java heap itself is small (-Xmx), the JVM may allocate it in the lower 4GB of address space along with the Class Pointers and Monitors\/Locks. If these Class Pointers, Monitors\/Locks and Java heap (if included) cannot fit in the lower 4GB, a native out of memory (NOOM) [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/library\/j-nativememory-linux\/] will be thrown. \nANSWER\nWhy Use Compressed References? \n\nBelow the 4GB mark, the JVM does not have to perform any compression\/decompression of the address pointer at runtime. Therefore, the best performance will be attained if the Class Pointers, Monitors\/Locks and Java heap can all be contained comfortably within the lowest 4GB of the address space. \n\n \n\nDetermining Address Location of Java Heap Memory \n\nTo verify if the Java heap has memory regions below the 4GB mark, check the \"Object Memory\" section in the javacore:\n\nConvert the \"start\" address from the hex value to a GB value [http:\/\/ss64.com\/convert.html]. In the example below, 0x000000000F010000=0.23GB which is below the the 4GB (0x0000000100000000) mark.\n\n\n\n * [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=1]\n\n\nSetting the Preferred Heap Base with -Xgc:preferredHeapBase \n\nStarting with Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0, and later, the JVM will determine if the Java heap will fit comfortably in the lower 4GB. If it is too large, the JVM will automatically allocate the Java heap above the 4GB mark (APAR IV37797 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1IV37797]). \n\n\n\nNOTE: In IBM System z platforms (i.e. z\/OS and z\/Linux), automatic shift of the heap above the 4GB address space does NOT occur because on these platforms, there is an additional performance penalty \nassociated with higher shift values. To resolve Native OOM issues due to a shortage of heap memory in the lower region on z platforms, use -Xnocompressedrefs (see below). \nSee related: IBM Knowledge Center - JVMJ9GC089W [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSYKE2_7.0.0\/com.ibm.java.messages\/diag\/appendixes\/messages\/j9gc\/message_jvmj9gc089.html] However, in earlier Java 6.1 and Java 7.0 versions (earlier than Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0), if the Java heap can not fit in the lower 4GB, a NOOM will occur. To avoid this problem, the generic JVM argument [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/understanding\/mm_compressed_references.html] can be used to ensure the Java heap is allocated above the 4GB address space. This will leave more room for the Class Pointer and Monitor\/Lock memory. \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * This will locate the Java heap starting at the 4GB mark thus leaving the lower 4GB for the other processes.\n\n\nIncrease Maximum Heap Size to Force Heap Allocation Above the 4GB mark \n\nAnother way to ensure that the heap is allocated above the 4GB mark (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later) is to set a maximum heap size equal to or greater than 4GB. For example -Xmx4G will ensure that the heap will have to be allocated above the 4GB mark. This will not work in earlier versions of the JVM since these earlier versions allowed the heap to straddle the 4GB mark, placing part of the memory above and some below (fixed as part of APAR IV37797) . \n\n \n\nFurther Investigation \n\nIf after setting -Xgc:preferredHeapBase=<address> or -Xmx4G a NOOM is still encountered (Java 6.1.6.0 and Java 7.0.5.0 and later), then further investigation is required at the application level. Look to decrease the size and usage of the applications Class Pointers and Monitors\/Locks. Additionally, there are some WebSphere Application Server troubleshooting methods that may help reduce the native memory footprint. See: IBM Troubleshooting native memory issues [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21373312].\n\nReserving Low-Memory Space with -Xmcrs\n\nIf there is still free memory in the system when a Native OutOfMemory (NOOM) occurs, then the problem may be a shortage of memory in the low-memory region (under 4GB). Even if the Java heap is located above this boundary, other data associated with Java objects can be located in the low-memory region.\n\nThe OS memory allocator will deal out low-memory freely, thus memory resources in the lower boundary may run out. Later when the JVM tries to allocate memory for an artifact which is required to be allocated in low-memory (because the JVM has only reserved a 32bit pointer for it) it fails and throws an OutOfMemoryError.\n\nStarting in Java 6.0.16.3, Java 6.1.8.3, Java 7.0.8.10, Java 7.1.2.10, there is a parameter -Xmcrs [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSYKE2_6.0.0\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/appendixes\/cmdline\/xmcrs.html] which allows the JVM to increase the amount of low memory it reserves on startup. With this setting, as long as the low-memory usage by the JVM does not exceed the -Xmcrs value, NOOM in the lower boundary will be avoided.\n\nTo set this parameter, first decide what a reasonable value for your lower memory requirements may be. Reasonable value is unique to each environment so there is not a general recommendation.\n\n\n * -Xmcrs<reasonable_value_for_lower_memory>\n\n * \n * NATIVEMEMINFO subcomponent dump routine\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=2]\n * \n\n\nDisabling Compressed References with -Xnocompressedrefs As a last resort, if the native memory still can not be contained under the 4GB mark, you can set -Xnocompressedrefs [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/appendixes\/cmdline\/Xnocompressedrefs.html] as a generic JVM argument. [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365] Using -Xnocompressedrefs will remove the use of compressed references and therefore remove the lower 4GB memory restriction on the Class Pointers and Monitors\/Locks. This will however, result in a significant increase in Java heap memory requirements. It is not uncommon for 70% more heap space to be required. Due to the increased memory requirements it is strongly advised that the Java heap size is adjusted to a larger value and garbage collection is monitored and retuned as required.\n\nAdditionally, some benchmarks show a 10-20% relative throughput decrease when disabling compressed references: \"Analysis shows that a 64-bit application without CR yields only 80-85% of 32-bit throughput but with CR yields 90-95%. Depending on application requirements, CR can improve performance up to 20% over standard 64-bit.\" See:ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf [ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf].\n\nBefore using -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution, first rule out the possibility of a native memory leak. Since using -Xnocompressedrefs will allow the the native memory to grow unbounded, a leak in native memory will lead to process size growth eventually leading to a process that needs to be paged out. The paging will incur performance overhead which will eventually lead to an unstable environment. Therefore careful consideration must be used when selecting -Xnocompressedrefs as a solution.\n\n\nMemory Map Considerations \n\nThe below figure is a generalization of how the JVM handles addresses in each section of the memory map based on heap size and compressed references (CR). Please note that at each stage beyond having all of the Java memory contained below the 4GB mark, there will be performance consequences: \n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=3] \n\nNo Compressed References Overhead using -Xnocompressedrefs \nor\n-Xmx > 25GB -increased memory footprint\n-fewer\/larger objects stored on heap leads to more frequent GC\n-lower cache and translation look aside buffer (TLB) utilization [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21660890&amp;aid=4] Compressed References Overhead maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is below 4GB none maximum heap address used by the Java JVM process is above 4GB but below 32GB compression\/decompression of address pointers \n\n\nGetting Assistance From IBM Support \nIf further assistance will be required from IBM WebSphere Support, please set the following -Xdump [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/tools\/dumpagents_syntax.html] parameters in the generic JVM arguments [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417365]: \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nThen restart the JVM and recreate the problem. Once the NOOM is encountered, process the resulting system core with jextract [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21577379]. Send the jextracted core file, heapdump, javacore, snap trace, systemOut.log, native_stderr.log, native_stdout.log and systemErr.log to IBM Support [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21153852] for further analysis. \nRELATED INFORMATION\n Linux\/Windows - Thanks for the memory [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/library\/j-nativememory-linux\/]\nAIX - Thanks for the Memory [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/library\/j-nativememory-aix\/]\nIntroducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf]\nCompressed references [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/javasdk\/v6r0\/topic\/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60\/diag\/understanding\/mm_compressed_references.html]\nIBM Java Compressed References and Native OOMs [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/community\/blogs\/kevgrig\/entry\/ibm_java_compressed_references_and_native_ooms]",

Such attribute is used by JCR when querying for theme policy information.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nCollect the following: \n\n * LDIF export of a sample user that hits this problem (if the backend user registry is LDAP)  * If you cannot determine a specific user causing the error, you can use the following tracestring to confirm:\n   \n   *=info:com.ibm.wps.policy.services.*=finest:com.ibm.wps.policy.commands.*=finest\n   \n   Then look for the following line in trace.log: com.ibm.wps.policy.services.PolicyService PolicyService() ENTRY userid contructor: {DN of user} \n   \n   \n * Resources.xml - can be found under  * <wp_profile>\/config\/cells\/<cellname>\/clusters\/<clustername>\/ for cluster \n    * <wp_profile>\/config\/cells\/<cellname>\/nodes\/<nodename>\/servers\/<portalservername>\/ for standalone\n   \n   \n\nLocate the WP PumaStoreService Resource Environment Provider in resources.xml and confirm if there is a defined property name for store.puma_default.user.fbadefault.filter. If not, then the default and active value for such property is \"uid\". If it does exist, then verify the attribute defined for the value. Then check the LDIF export for the user to confirm if such attribute is defined. \nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nCreate\/update the store.puma_default.user.fbadefault.filter custom property for the WP PumaStoreService Resource Environment Provider via the Integrated Solutions Console to an attribute that exists for all Portal users in the backend user registry (for example, \"cn\").\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Puma Store Service [http:\/\/www-10.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Puma_Store_Service_wp8]\nSetting service configuration properties [http:\/\/www-10.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Setting_service_configuration_properties_wp8?OpenDocument&sa=true]",

The internal error message is: #{SelectionBean.asynchAction}: javax.faces.el.EvaluationException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.sql.SQLException: The transaction is no longer active - status: 'Marked rollback. [Reason=weblogic.transaction.internal.TimedOutException: Transaction timed out after 601 seconds BEA1-5057DF8C316E1C1224CD]'. No further JDBC access is allowed within this transaction. \n\n... \n\n \n\nOn WebSphere: \nTimeoutManage I WTRN0006W: Transaction XXX has timed out after 300 seconds.\nTimeoutManage I WTRN0124I: When the timeout occurred the thread with which the transaction is, or was most recently, associated was Thread[WebContainer : 3,5,main]. The stack trace of this thread when the timeout occurred was: \nilog.rules.brl.parsing.parser.earley.IlrEarleyParser.errorRecovery(IlrEarleyParser.java:1046)\nilog.rules.brl.parsing.parser.earley.IlrEarleyParser.buildCharts(IlrEarleyParser.java:772)\nilog.rules.brl.parsing.parser.earley.IlrEarleyParser.parse(IlrEarleyParser.java:511)\n...\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe transaction timeout for RTS\/DC is set to 10 minutes by default in the teamserver web module deployment descriptor (WEB-INF\/web.xml), and application servers also have container level transaction timeouts that are configurable. If a transactional operation performed by RTS\/DC takes longer than these timeouts to complete, the transaction is rolled back and the operation is not completed.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIf you perform time consuming operations in large repositories, you can increase the timeout value in the web.xml file of the RTS\/DC EAR file (jrules-teamserver-<appserver>.ear\\teamserver.war\\WEB-INF) by changing the value of the property ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout. \n\n\nYou will find the property in the file web.xml defined as below:\n...\n<context-param>\n<description>Modify the timeout value that is associated with transactions (in seconds)<\/description>\n<param-name>ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout<\/param-name>\n<param-value>600<\/param-value>\n<\/context-param> \n... \n\nAnother place to look for are application server specific transaction timeout configurations. For example, for WebSphere Application Server, check the \"Maximum transaction timeout\" and increase it as needed as described here [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wasinfo\/v8r0\/topic\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/info\/ae\/ae\/tjta_settlog.html].\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 7.5 Enterprise Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 8.0.1, 8.0 Enterprise",

    "reference_doc": "IBM Verify an IEM server upgrade is still in progress - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How can I tell if the IBM Endpoint Manager (BigFix) server database upgrade is progressing? \n\nCAUSE\nWhen upgrading a BigFix server, most of the time is usually spent upgrading the database. The installer launches the BESAdmin utility to complete this part of the upgrade, but does not provide detailed progress during this phase. For some long running upgrades, it may appear that the upgrade is hung or not progressing: \n\nOn Windows, the BESAdmin UI will indicate \"Not Responding\" if clicked on at this point. \n\nOn Linux, the message \"Info: Configuring the database for the server component, please wait ... \" is reported.\n\n\nANSWER\nIt is important to allow the upgrade to complete when in this state, and not attempt to cancel or kill the upgrade process. To verify the upgrade is still active, check that the following process is still running: \n\nWindows: BESAdmin.exe \n\nLinux: BESAdmin \n\nCPU usage of BESAdmin may be minimal during times when the database is doing most of the work, so just the existence of the process is good confirmation. For additional confirmation, the BFEnterprise or BFENT database can be monitored for activity using SQL Server Profiler or the DB2 'CREATE EVENT MONITOR' statement to track SQL statement events.",

This release provides the following updates to IBM Security Network Protection Firmware Version 5.3.1. \n\nCONTENT\nServiceability and support enhancements: \n\n * You can now get additional information about your system through the command line within your \"Tools\" directory. We have added the Sysinfo command that will display system CPU, memory, and storage information in command line interface (CLI).\n   Note: A complete list of CLI commands are located in the Command-line interface [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSHLHV_5.3.1\/com.ibm.alps.doc\/references\/alps_command_line_interface.htm] section in the Knowledge Center.\n   \n * New to this release we have added a services mode within CLI. These commands will allow you to restart key services within the appliance. These services are listed below:  * Packet processing \n    * Packet Capture \n    * Local Management Interface (LMI) \n    * License and Update (LUM) \n    * SiteProtector Communication\n      \n   \n   \n * You can now view and search logs from the command line using the \"less\" and \"tail\" commands from within logs mode. Log files found using the less command are System, Webserver, Updates and Analysis logs. \n   \n * With the admin-sftp account you can now retrieve Snapshots, Packet Captures, and support files. This account uses the same password as the admin account. \n   Note: More details on admin-sftp can be found in the Downloading files with an SFTP client [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSHLHV_5.3.1\/com.ibm.alps.doc\/tasks\/alps_downloading_sftp.htm]documentation on the Knowledge Center. [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSHLHV_5.3.1\/com.ibm.alps.doc\/tasks\/alps_downloading_sftp.htm]\n\n\nResponse enhancement:  * Forwarded events (Remote Syslog Alert Responses) will show the same details as the content sent to SiteProtector. \n * Support for using the TCP protocol when creating Remote Syslog Alert Responses to prevent messages being truncated and improve delivery reliability over using UDP.\n\n\nNetwork Access Policy enhancement:  * You can now use the network access policy to control network access when the HTTP X-Forward-For (XFF) header is enabled. The network policy can use the XFF header along with the packet source to control network traffic.\n\n\nIPS Policy enhancements:  * You can now derive a new IPS object from an existing IPS object by right-clicking on an IPS object and left-clicking on Clone.\n   \n * When enabling network, transport-layer, and status events in a non-default IPS object, a warning message is shown. This will help to minimize what may be seen as a false negative.\n\n\nPerformance:  * Inspection throughput increase for XGS 7100 up to 25Gbps, FPL5 (25Gbps) added.\n\n\nMiscellaneous updates and implementation changes:  * Top 10 URLs and URL categories widget in the Local Management Interface have been disabled by default. Given the limited popularity of this feature, coupled with the performance impact in certain situations, we disabled the feature by default. You can re-enable it by using the advanced parameter tune.url.topten.tracking=true. \n   \n *  We have removed the MultiCast Domain Name System (mDNS), under some configurations it caused security risks within the appliance.\n   \n * Support for mutual certificate authentication for communication between the Network Security appliance and SiteProtector.\n\n\nKnown issues: \nYou can find a list of known issues for IBM Security Network Protection 5.3.1 in Technote 1715537: Known issues for IBM Security Network Protection version 5.3.1 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21715537]. \n\n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=1] [https:\/\/ibm.biz\/BdHdZx] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=2] [http:\/\/ibm.biz\/InfraSecForumTechnote] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=3] [http:\/\/ibm.biz\/SecSuptUTube] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=4] [http:\/\/ibm.biz\/InfraSecFixes] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=5] [http:\/\/ibm.biz\/FlexLicLogin] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=6] [http:\/\/ibm.biz\/MyNotification] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21902778&aid=7] [http:\/\/ibm.biz\/ContactSecSupport] \nRELATED INFORMATION\n A Japanese translation is available [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21903740]",

Eclipse changed the window system requirement from motif to gtk on UNIX operating systems. For AIX, this Eclipse window system change requires the gtk libraries to be installed to support the GUI. For Installation Manager, the GUI is the wizard mode of operation. \n\nYou can use Installation Manager without the gtk libraries. For information on console mode, command-line mode, or silent mode; see the Installation Manager Information Center [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/install\/v1r6\/topic\/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc\/topics\/c_modes.html]. Silent mode uses a response file and command-line mode is supported by all packages. For console mode, check your product documentation to verify that the product supports console mode.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo use the GUI, the gtk+ RPM and dependencies must be available on AIX. \n\n\nInstall this set of RPMs on AIX:\n\n\natk-1.12.3-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ncairo-1.8.8-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nexpat-2.0.1-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfontconfig-2.4.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfreetype2-2.3.9-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngettext-0.10.40-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nglib2-2.12.4-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngtk2-2.10.6-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibjpeg-6b-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nlibpng-1.2.32-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibtiff-3.8.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npango-1.14.5-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npixman-0.12.0-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxcursor-1.1.7-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxft-2.1.6-5.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nxrender-0.9.1-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nzlib-1.2.3-3.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\n\nThe installed RPMs must be of the minimum versions listed above.\n\nTo install the RPM versions specified above take the following steps: \n\n\n 1. Download the gtk2_bundle_v2.tar package [ftp:\/\/ftp.software.ibm.com\/aix\/freeSoftware\/aixtoolbox\/ezinstall\/ppc\/] (version 'v2') containing all the RPMs and the install script to a new directory. \n    \n    \n 2. Decompress the tar file. \n    You can use the command tar -xvf gtk2_bundle_<version>.tar to decompress the file.\n    \n    \n 3. Open the decompressed directory gtk2_bundle_<version> and run the install.sh script.\n    \n    The script will check if the required RPMs are installed at the compatible level. If they are not, the script will prompt to install the compatible versions.\n    \n    \n 4. Verify the environment variable LIBPATH contains a path to the installed libraries. \n    For example LIBPATH=\/opt\/freeware\/lib\/\n\n\nNote that if you download and install RPMs individually, we have found that the following libraries are incompatible:  * glib2-2.14.6-2 and gtk2-2.10.6-5 \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Unreadable characters in the GUI when using X11 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21661861]",

The memory for the third parameter was not handled properly.\nAnd accessing this parameter by other attribute group would result\ninto crash.\n\nAPAR: IJ00815\nAbstract: Device Detail attribute AUTOGROWTH behaviour not in sync\nwith SQL Server. \nAdditional Information: In case when data file autogrowth was disabled\nand max-size was set to unlimited, then the incorrect values were\ndisplayed for filegroup detail attribute(Max Growth Size) and device\ndetail attribute(Growth).\n\nAPAR: IJ01540\nAbstract: False alerts are being generated as default value \"Not\nCollected\" for \"Database Space Pct Used\" attribute is not correctly\nconverted before sending to TEPS.\nAdditional Information: Situations having default value\n[ Not Collected (-1 ) ] in formula were not getting evaluated correctly\nfor some database detail attributes. However, the data was shown\ncorrectly as ‘Not Collected’ on the portal.\n\nAPAR: IJ05451 \nAbstract: ITCAM SQL Server Agent's collector process crashes when using\nSQL Server Native Client 10.0 or SQL Server Native Client 11.0 as\nODBC driver.\nAdditional Information: Collector was not able to handle all possible values\nreturned by ODBC when using SQL Server Native Client 10.0 and SQL Server\nNative Client 11.0 causing it to crash.\n\n2.2 DEFECTS:\n-----------------\nDEFECT: 170986\nAbstract: Memory leak in Table Detail attribute group. \nAdditional Information: Memory leak observed in Table Detail attribute\ngroup because incorrect de-allocation handling. \n\nDEFECT: 170987\nAbstract: Crash observed in Availability group details attribute group\nand Table detail attribute group\nAdditional Information: Crash observed in Availability group details\nattribute group and in Table detail attribute group for the wrong\nusage of iterator after erase. Issue happened because an attempt to\nincrement the iterator was made after the iterator was deleted through\nerase function. \n\nDEFECT: 170993\nAbstract: intial size > max size gives incorrect values\nAdditional Information: If a database was created with restricted growth\nand then modifed the initial size of the database file to a value\ngreater than it's maxsize, then the value of maxsize was not updated\ncorrectly (ideally in this case maxsize should become equal to initial\nsize). As a result, query to SQL Server returned false value for\nmaxsize due to which incorrect values were getting displayed on portal\nfor attributes in Database Detail, Device Detail and Filegroup Detail\nattribute groups.\n\nDEFECT: 170994\nAbstract: Incorrect value displayed for Database Detail attributes\nwhen autogrowth disabled and data freespace > drive freespace.\nAdditional Information: In cases when data file autogrowth was disabled\nand data freespace was greater than device freespace then incorrect\nvalue were seen for some attributes(Data Freespace , Aggregate Database\nFreespace , Database Space pct used , Aggregate Database Freespace pct,\nDatabase max growth size). \n\nDEFECT: 171127\nAbstract: Add tolerance support for SQL Server 2017.\nAdditional Information: Added support for SQL Server 2017 version.\n\nDEFECT: 171244\nAbstract: Spelling mistake in agent configuration panel.\nAdditional Information: Few spelling mistakes in agent configuration\npanel were corrected.\n\nDEFECT: 171318\nAbstract: Usage of KOQ_ODBC_DRIVER variable in pre-req while making\nsql server connection.\nAdditional Information: During pre-requisite check, the value of\n‘Driver’ was hardcoded to ‘SQL Server‘. While later on, for collecting\ndata value for 'Driver’ was picked from ‘KOQ_ODBC_DRIVER’ variable.\nDue to this, issue was seen during pre-requiste connection but later\non data was being collected successfully.\n\nDEFECT: 171379\nAbstract: High Severity vulnerabilities are resolved to avoid undefined\nbehaviour of the agent.\nAdditional Information: Removed the high severity errors in the code,\ndetected in CPPCheck tool.\n\nDEFECT: 171785\nAbstract: DBD_TEMP rename failed with error [32]\nAdditional Information: Renaming of DBD_TEMP to DBD_PREV files was\nfailing with Error 32 (The process cannot access the file because it\nis being used by another process)because DBD_TEMP file handle was\ntaking time to close. \n\nDEFECT: 171979\nAbstract: Incorrect value is being sent when query is failed in SRV1\ncursor.\nAdditional Information: Zero value was being sent when query fails in\nSRV1 cursor which was incorrect. Zero is a meaningful value which does\nnot indicate failure.\n\nDEFECT: 171981\nAbstract: Not Collected value is frequently sent since database\ndetail collection is not getting completed in 45 seconds.\nAdditional Information: When database detail collection took more\nthan 45 seconds for collection, Not collected values were sent which\nresulted into triggering of situation.\n\nDEFECT: 172173\nAbstract: Environment setting for COLL_DBCC_NO_LOCK was not taking\neffect. Similar issue was seen with COLL_MONITOR_ALL_DATABASES.\nAdditional Information: Values were getting overwritten for above two\nvariables, hence queries were running without NoLock hint and monitoring\nof all database setting was not working as expected.\n\nDEFECT: 173699\nAbstract: No data get collected for server summary attribute group.\nAdditional Information: SRV3,one of the pre-cursor of server summary\nattribute group, was failing as its query was executed with (null)\noption. Hence no data was collected for server summary attribute group.\n\nDEFECT: 174076\nAbstract: MSSQLQA: Sometime server detail data is not getting displayed\non portal.\nAdditional Information: SRV3, one of the pre-cursor of server summary\nattribute group, was failing as its query was executed with (null)\noption. Hence sometimes server detail data was not getting displayed\non portal.\n\nDEFECT: 174077\nAbstract: crypted SQL password in log file.\nAdditional Information: Encrypted password value in logfile is \nreplaced with fixed length string to avoid security breach.\n\nDEFECT: 174420\nAbstract: Last Statistics Query execution failing for table details\nattribute group.\nAdditional Information: Due to query failure,table detail data was\ncollected only for the first time.

The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\nBefore installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment\nvariable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation\ndirectory.\n\nFor example:\n> CANDLEHOME=\/opt\/IBM\/ITM\n> export CANDLEHOME\n\n- Refer to section 7.0 entitled \"Known problems and workarounds\"\nbefore installation.\n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n----------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory\non the system that contains the agent code to be updated. For\nthe purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the \nsupported platforms.\n\n3. Use the \"itmpatch\" command to install the fix for that agent\nplatform. For more information on the \"itmpatch\" command, see\nsection 6.2.\n\nOn Windows systems, if the fix was expanded to\n<TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001, the install command is:\n\nFor 32 bit Agent:\n> <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME>\n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\KOQ_winnt_tema_if0001.cab\n\nFor 64 bit Agent:\n> <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\KOQ_wix64_tema_if0001.cab\n\nNote : Use \"itmpatch\" command from <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\\ \ntemporary directory.\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n-----------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to a temporary directory\non the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system. For the\npurpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the fully\nqualified path to this directory.\nNote: On Windows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the \nsupported platforms.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use\nthe \"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME\/bin on UNIX\nsystems or in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more\ninformation on the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nOn UNIX systems,\nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\/6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\/6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\n\nOn Windows systems,\nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\\6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001\n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to \nbe added to the depot. \n\n4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the\n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see \"IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring Command Reference\".\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063113001\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t OQ -n <Managed system name> -v 063113001\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is \nspecified as two characters (oq), not three characters (koq).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the\nmanaged system name of the operating system (OS) agent to be\nupdated.\nThe target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is always\nan OS agent.\n\n5. To check if Remote Agent Update is SUCCESS\/INPROGRESS\/FAILED use the command \n>tacmd getDeployStatus -g <transaction id>\n\nwhere transaction id is the id provided after updateAgent command.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nUse the following steps to update the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli \nEnterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nServers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Expand the archive file (koq_tems_teps_tepd_if0001.tar or .zip)\nthat contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Desktop using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or an \nextract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a \ndirectory structure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM,\nwith the necessary updates.\n\n4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) script to launch either \nGUI installation or silent installation of the application \nsupport files. \n\nNote: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one\nof the following additional steps must be performed.\n\n1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version \nof the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM \nTivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer, \n6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002 at \nhttp:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]\nfor download and installation instructions.\n\n2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to \na java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running \nthe itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below. \n\nGUI installation option\n------------------------\nThe GUI can be started by using one of the following commands\nfrom within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located.\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> .\/itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the\n\"bin\" directory where Java(R) is installed.\nThe location of Java on your system might\nvary.\n\nWhen prompted by the Application Support Installer for the \ninstallable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not\nthe component directory. The installer can install updates for \nmultiple components at the same time.\n\nSilent installation option\n--------------------------\nTo use the silent installation option, use one of the following\ncommands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is \nlocated. \n\nNote: Agent support upgrade for IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 \nor above on Linux, zLinux, Solaris and windows operating systems \nrequires the following files contained in interim fix \n6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002. This is applicable to both GUI and \nsilent installation option of agent support upgrade.\n- Linux: setupLinux.bin\n- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin\n- Solaris: setupSolaris.bin\n- Windows: setupwin32.exe\n\nFollow the installation instructions contained in the\n\"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0002.README\".\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> .\/itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent] \n[-r <response file>] \n[-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent] \n[-r <response file>] \n[-j <JAVAHOME>] \n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-r <response file> - Required. Customized response file name.\nThe default response file \"response.txt\" in\nthe CD-ROM directory can be copied and\nmodified as per your environment.\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the\n\"bin\" directory where Java(R) is installed.\nThe location of Java on your system might\nvary.\n\n5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer \nasks for the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components\nyou want to add application support to.\nFor this fix, the check boxes should be set as follows:\n\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server(TEMS)\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server(TEPS)\nChecked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client(TEPD)\n\nContinue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the\nMicrosoft SQL Server 06.31.13.01 support to complete the\ninstallation.\n\nNote: When support is installed using CLI or GUI for any of the\nabove Tivoli Monitoring components, they are restarted. \n\n\n6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Browser was running when the update was installed, it\nmust be restarted.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n=======================================\nAny existing Microsoft SQL Server Agent instances should be restarted\nafter the installation of this fix.\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n--------------------------------------------------\nFix (6.3.1.13-TIV-ITM_SQL-IF0001) includes changes to the agent\nbaroc files which need to be reinstalled. If you have already\ninstalled these baroc files, there are no additional installation\nsteps. If not, refer to IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Installation\nand Setup Guide under \"Installing monitoring agent baroc files\non the event server\" in \"Installing the IBM Tivoli Enterprise\nConsole Event Synchronization\" section for more information.\n\n6.2 Additional information on using \"itmpatch\" command\n----------------------------------------------------\nThe \"itmpatch\" command has the following syntax.\n\nUsage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nwhere:\n-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory\n-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be \ninstalled\n-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch\n\nFor example, on UNIX systems:\n- To preview the fix installation, use the \"-t\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>\/bin\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>\n\n- To install the fix, use the \"-i\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>\/bin\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>\n\nwhere:\n<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring \ninstallation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include\nthe drive letter.\n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where\nthe fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive\nletter.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the \"tacmd\" command\nto view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer prior to viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli \nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems -t OQ\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t OQ \n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the tacmd \"listSystems\" command is \nspecified as two characters (OQ), not three characters (KOQ).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n06.31.13.01.\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthe agent was successfully updated.\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is \n06.31.13.01.\n\n2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use \nthe \"kincinfo\" command on Windows systems or the \"cinfo\" command\non Linux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the \nversions of the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli \nEnterprise Monitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop systems after this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote: The displayed build date and installation date might not \nbe accurate. This is known problem.\n\nOn UNIX or Linux systems:\n-------------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n.\/cinfo -i\n\nOn Windows systems:\n-------------------\nTo validate that all components have been installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\nFor example:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\InstallITM\\kincinfo -i\n\nC:\\Users\\Administrator>kincinfo -i\n*********** Thursday, May 10, 2018 04:36:22 PM ************\nUser : Administrator Group : NA\nHost Name : HJS497-MSQL-T-1 Installer : Ver: 063007000\nCandleHome : C:\\IBM\\ITM\nInstallitm : C:\\IBM\\ITM\\InstallITM\n*************************************************************\n...Product Inventory\nOQ TEMS App Support\/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWICMS Version: 06.31.13.01 Build: 81136\n\nOQ TEPS App Support\/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWICMS Version: 06.31.13.01 Build: 81136\n\nOQ TEPB App Support\/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWICMS Version: 06.31.13.00 Build: 71541\n\nOQ TEPD App Support\/Microsoft SQL Server Support\nWICMS Version: 06.31.13.01 Build: 81136\n\n\n7.0 Known problems and workarounds\n==================================\nAbstract: itmpatch command fails during upgrade\nProblem: When itmpatch command is executed, it fails while upgrading\nagent fix pack.

Unix error code 24.\n\nNew sockets\/file descriptors can not be opened after the limit has been reached. \n\n\nCAUSE\nSystem configuration limitation.\n\nWhen the \"Too Many Open Files\" error message is written to the logs, it indicates that all available file handles for the process have been used (this includes sockets as well). In a majority of cases, this is the result of file handles being leaked by some part of the application. This technote explains how to collect output that identifies what file handles are in use at the time of the error condition.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\n\n\n\nDetermine Ulimits\n\nOn UNIX and Linux operating systems, the ulimit for the number of file handles can be configured, and it is usually set too low by default. Increasing this ulimit to 8000 is usually sufficient for normal runtime, but this depends on your applications and your file\/socket usage. Additionally, file descriptor leaks can still occur even with a high value. \n\nDisplay the current soft limit:\nulimit -Sn\n\nDisplay the current hard limit:\nulimit -Hn\n\nOr capture a Javacore, the limit will be listed in that file under the name NOFILE:\nkill -3 PID\n\n\nPlease see the following document if you would like more information on where you can edit ulimits:\nGuidelines for setting ulimits (WebSphere Application Server)\nhttp:\/\/www.IBM.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg21469413]\n\n\nOperating Systems \n\nWindows By default, Windows does not ship with a tool to debug this type of problem. Instead Microsoft provides a tool that you can download called Process Explorer [http:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sysinternals\/bb896653]. This tool identifies the open handles\/files associated with the Java™ process (but usually not sockets opened by the Winsock component) and determines which handles are still opened. These handles result in the \"Too many open files\" error message. \n\nTo display the handles, click on the Gear Icon [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&amp;aid=1] in the toolbar (or press CTRL+ H to toggle the handles view). The icon will change to the icon for DLL files (so you can toggle it back to the DLL view). \n\nIt is important that you change the Refresh Rate. Select View > Update Speed, and change it to 5 seconds. \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21067352&aid=2] \n\nThere is also another Microsoft utility called Handle that you can download from the following URL: \nhttps:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sysinternals\/bb896655.aspx [https:\/\/technet.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sysinternals\/bb896655.aspx] \n\nThis tool is a command line version of Process Explorer. The URL above contains the usage instructions. \n\n\nAIX \nThe commands lsof and procfiles are usually the best commands to determine what files and sockets are opened.. \n\nlsof \nTo determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThis output does not give the actual file names to which the handles are open. It provides only the name of the file system (directory) in which they are contained. The lsof command indicates if the open file is associated with an open socket or a file. When it references a file, it identifies the file system and the inode, not the file name. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nprocfiles \nThe procfiles command does provide similar information, and also displays the full filenames loaded. It may not show sockets in use. \n\nprocfiles -n [PID] > procfiles.out \n\n\nOther commands (to display filenames that are opened) \n\nINODES and DF \ndf -kP filesystem_from_lsof | awk '{print $6}' | tail -1 \n>> Note the filesystem name \nfind filesystem_name -inum inode_from_lsof -print > filelist.out \n>> Shows the actual file name \n\nsvmon \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep pers (for JFS) \nsvmon -P PID -m | grep clnt (for JFS2, NFS) \n(this opens files in the format: filesystem_device:inode) \n\nUse the same procedure as above for finding the actual file name. \n\n\nLinux To determine if the number of open files is growing over a period of time, issue lsof to report the open files against a PID on a periodic basis. For example: \n\nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nThe output will provide you with all of the open files for the specified PID. You will be able to determine which files are opened and which files are growing over time. \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\nAlternately you can list the contents of the file descriptors as a list of symbolic links in the following directory, where you replace PID with the process ID. This is especially useful if you don't have access to the lsof command: \n\nls -al \/proc\/PID\/fd \n\n\nSolaris Run the following commands to monitor open file (socket) descriptors on Solaris: \n\npfiles \n\/usr\/proc\/bin\/pfiles [ PID ] > pfiles.out \n\nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.ou t \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\nHP-UX \nlsof \nlsof -p [ PID ] > lsof.out \n\nThis will get one round of lsof output. If you want to determine if the number of open files is growing over time, you can issue the command with the -r option to capture multiple intervals: \nlsof -p [PID] -r [interval in seconds, 1800 for 30 minutes] > lsof.out \n\nIt is best to capture lsof several times to see the rate of growth in the file descriptors. \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK",

    "reference_doc": "IBM HTTP Session time-out settings and overwrite precedence rules - United States\n\nWebSphere http session management time-out wasrun precedence overwrite TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n It is possible to set the HTTP Session time-out in various places on the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server Administrative Console. It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. \n\nSince Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. \n\nCAUSE\nApplication needs HTTP session time-out set.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: \n\n * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels \n * At the time when the application is packaged \n * In the application code\n\n\nSetting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console \n1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. \n\n\n2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. \n\n\n3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n          <session-config> \n      *          <session-timeout>60<\/session-timeout>\n * \n *       <\/session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. \n\nHTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary \n\nThe list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. \n\n1.

    "reference_doc": "IBM JMSExceptions CWSIT0006E and CWSIA0241E on bus connect - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Your application throws JMS exceptions CWSIT0006E and CWSIA0241E when trying to connect to a WebSphere Application Server (WAS) Service Integration Bus (SIBus). \n\nSYMPTOM\nApplication throws the following JMS exceptions in the stack trace while trying to connect to the SIBus: \n\nJMSException caught\njavax.jms.JMSException: CWSIA0241E: An exception was received during the call to the method\nJmsManagedConnectionFactoryImpl.createConnection:\ncom.ibm.websphere.sib.exception.SIResourceException: CWSIT0006E: It is not possible to contact\na messaging engine in bus YOURBUS..\nat\ncom.ibm.ws.sib.api.jms.impl.JmsManagedConnectionFactoryImpl.createConnection(JmsManagedConnectionFactoryImpl.java:225)\nat\ncom.ibm.ws.sib.api.jms.impl.JmsManagedConnectionFactoryImpl.createConnection(JmsManagedConnectionFactoryImpl.java:148)\n\n\nCAUSE\nThis can be caused by a stopped messaging engine, a wrong or misspelled bus name (case-sensitive) in the connection factory settings or, the HA manager is not able to find the running messaging engine.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe error messages CWSIA0241E and CWSIT0006E indicate that when the connection was attempted, there were no running messaging engines available on the specified bus. To see why the messaging engines were not available, check the SystemOut.log for applicable messages. Examine the SystemOut.log file starting at the time period when the application experienced the problem and search backward. \n\n\nCheck for the CWSID0016I which indicates status of the Messaging Engine activity. You may see messages like this:\n\nSibMessage I [:] CWSID0016I: Messaging engine [mename]is in state Stopping.\nSibMessage I [:] CWSID0016I: Messaging engine [mename]is in state Stopped.\n\nThe solution for this problem is to start the messaging engine.\n\nIf the messaging engine is running and you still see these errors at the application side, other possible reasons for this problem are:\n\n1) Check provider end points. The value for the provider endpoints should be in the format of host_name:port_number:BootstrapBasicMessaging.\n\nIn the JMS connection factory, you can define a list of provider endpoints that govern which servers the application will attempt to connect to. If you have defined these endpoints, ensure that the messaging engines for these servers have all started and that the port and transport chains defined in the endpoint list are correct. Also, ensure that the values for the Connection proximity (bus, cluster, host or server) and the Target groups and Target significance settings are appropriate. For example, if the Target significance value is Required and no suitable messaging engine could be located, then this would cause a connection failure. Please refer to the following links for how to set provider endpoints:\n\nDefault messaging provider queue connection factory [Settings] : [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSAW57_8.5.5\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/ae\/SIBJMSQueueConnectionFactory_DetailForm.html]\n\nDefault messaging provider topic connection factory [Settings]: [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSAW57_8.5.5\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/ae\/SIBJMSTopicConnectionFactory_DetailForm.html]\n\nRestart the server after making the change.\n\n2) If your environment is heavily loaded, the HA manager might not be able to locate the running messaging engine within three seconds. In this case, check if there are any hung threads in the SystemOut.log, and resolve them if possible. Next, consider increasing the value of sib.trm.linger from three to give the HA manager more time to locate a messaging engine.\n\nTune the sib.trm.linger property value in the sib.properties file to set the messaging engine lookup delay so that the Work Load Manager (WLM) waits for a longer period of time before returning an error. Please refer to information below on how to set this property in the sib.properties. \n\n1)<WAS_HOME>\/properties : The properties declared under this location would be applicable to all the profiles in that installation.\n\n2)<PROFILE_ROOT>\/properties : The properties declared here are applicable for all the servers on this profile\n\nIf a property is defined at both <PROFILE_ROOT>\/properties and <WAS_HOME>\/properties, then the property defined at <PROFILE_ROOT>\/properties would take precedence.\n\nAfter resetting the property you must restart the server.\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere MQ Not Applicable Business Integration WebSphere Process Server Business Integration WebSphere Service Registry and Repository Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Standard Business Integration WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus Business Integration WebSphere Partner Gateway Advanced Edition Configuration Business Integration WebSphere MQ Configuration \nPRODUCT ALIAS\/SYNONYM\n WebSphere Application Server WAS SIB SIBUS SI BUS",

The Combined Cumulative Fix is a package of WebSphere Portal fixes and Web Content Manager Cumulative fixes. \n\nWhat's New \n\nAs of WebSphere Portal V7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fix 26 (CF26), support has been added for syndicating to subscribers running WebSphere Portal V8.0.0.1 Combined Cumulative Fix 09 (CF09) or later. \n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpace requirements \n\nEnsure that enough disk space is available in the following directories: \n\nz\/OS: 625 cylinders in the directory where you download the cumulative fix, 625 cylinders in the <Portal Configuration HFS>, 625 cylinders in <WebSphere Configuration HFS> and 1250 cylinders in your system temp directory. \n\nAll other platforms: 2 GB in the directory where you download the cumulative fix, 1 GB in <Portal_Install_Root>, 1 GB in <wp_profile_root> temporary disk space and 1 GB in your system temp directory, such as \/tmp on Unix or Linux platforms or C:\\temp on the Microsoft Windows platform. \n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps for installing Combined Cumulative Fix \n\nBEFORE YOU BEGIN:\nFamiliarize yourself with the Portal Upgrade Best Practices available from IBM Remote Technical Support for WebSphere Portal.\n\nPortal Upgrades: Best Practices for V7.0 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21452611] For instructions on how to validate your environment prior to the upgrade, see the instructions for running the Health Checker tool for WebSphere Portal at:\n\nHealth Checker tool for WebSphere Portal V7.0 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27020200] IMPORTANT: Certain security configurations can cause failures with the upgrade. Please check the following technote to see if this may apply to your environment.\n\nFix Pack 7.0.0.1 fails at action-import-defaultnodes-wp.filestore\/base task. [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21496067] \n 1. Perform the following steps before installing Combined Cumulative fix:\n     1. Before you install this combined cumulative fix, check to see if the list of fixes already installed on your system is included in the list of fixes provided in this combined cumulative fix. If you have temporary, interim or cumulative fixes on your system that are not included in this Combined Cumulative Fix, then uninstall those fixes before installing this Combined Cumulative Fix and contact IBM Support for an updated version of that fix, or for more information. \n     2. If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server, stop the Web server. \n     3. Verify that the information in the wkplc.properties, wkplc_dbdomain.properties, wkplc_dbtype.properties, and wkplc_comp.properties files are correct. WebSphere Portal 7 introduced support for multiple profiles. If using multiple profiles, also verify that the information in each profile is correct. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http:\/\/www-10.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].  * Enter a value for the PortalAdminPwd and WasPassword parameters in the wkplc.properties file. \n         * Ensure that the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters are defined correctly for all database domains in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. \n         * Unix\/Linux\/Windows\/IBM i Only: The WebSphere Portal Update Installer removes plain text passwords from the wkplc*.properties files. To keep these passwords in the properties files, include the following line in the wkplc.properties file: PWordDelete=false. \n         * Ensure that the value of the XmlAccessPort property in wkplc_comp.properties matches the value of the port used for HTTP connections to the WebSphere Portal server. \n        \n        \n     4. Special considerations for multiple profiles or binary install or migration upgrade:  1. If you did a binary installation and created a WebSphere Portal profile later, or your Portal 7.0.0.x was migrated from 6.1.x, ensure that the PortalServer\/wps.properties file correctly references the profile. The Portal Update Installer uses the wps.properties file to determine which profile is the primary profile to update. Failure to complete this step could result in an inoperable Portal server after the Combined Cumulative Fix installation completes.  1. Edit the <PortalServer root>\/wps.properties file in a text editor \n             2. Add these two properties if they do not already exist:\n                ProfileName=<your profile name, e.g. wp_profile>\n                ProfileDirectory=<your profile directory, e.g. \/opt\/IBM\/WebSphere\/wp_profile>\n                \n                Note: The ProfileDirectory property should use forward slash (\/) instead of backslash (\\) on Windows.\n            \n            \n         2. If you have created multiple profiles. the Portal Update Installer will automatically upgrade all profiles. If you want to specify which profiles are updated, then complete the following steps:  1. Edit the <PortalServer root>\/wps.properties file in a text editor \n             2. Add this property if it does not already exist:\n                AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles=<comma separated list of profile names, e.g. wp_profile, wp_profile2, wp_profile3>\n            \n            \n         3. If using Multiple Profiles, verify all your profiles are at the same level before starting upgrade.\n            \n        \n        \n     5. Perform the following steps to download the Combined Cumulative Fix and the WebSphere Portal Update Installer:  1. Download the latest Combined Cumulative fix (e.g. 7.0.0.2-WP-WCM-Combined-CFPMnnnnn-CFnnn), and the latest WebSphere Portal Update Installer from http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24027857 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24027857]. \n         2. Create the PortalServer_root\/update directory and extract the WebSphere Portal Update Installer file into this directory. \n         3. Create the PortalServer_root\/update\/fixes directory and extract the 7.0.0.2-WP-WCM-Combined-CFPMnnnnn-CFnnn.zip file into this directory, where n is the numbers associated with the version of the Combined Cumulative fix. Note for z\/OS users: refer to Installing interim fixes on WebSphere Portal Enable for z\/OS using Portal Update Installer [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21326670] for detailed descriptions of how to execute steps ii. and iii. above. \n            \n        \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n2. Choose either the graphical user interface installation option or the command line installation option: \n\nNOTE: Not all platforms can use the graphical user interface (IBM i and z\/OS can only use command line). \n\nNOTE: If the installation fails, use the IBM Support Assistant [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/support\/isa\/] to access support-related information and serviceability tools for problem determination. For IBM i, download ISA on a system other than IBM i. On the Support Assistant Welcome page, click Service. Then click the Create Portable Collector link to create a remotely collect the data from your IBM i system. Fix what is causing the problem and then rerun the installation task. \n\n\nIf using the Universal PUI, (which does not include the bundled Java environment), run the following command, setupCmdLine.bat for Windows or . .\/setupCmdLine.sh for Unix\/Linux from the was_profile_root\/bin directory to set up the Java environment for the graphical user interface installation program. When updating a Portal that does not have a profile because it was installed with isBinaryInstall=\"true\", then run setupCmdLine.bat|.sh from PortalServer_root\/bin. z\/OS users can not use the Universal PUI. \n\nEnter the following command to launch the graphical user interface installation program:  *  Windows: PortalServer_root\\update> updatePortalWizard.bat Unix\/Linux: PortalServer_root\/update> .\/updatePortalWizard.sh\n   \n   - OR -\n   Perform the following steps to launch the installation program from the command line:  1. Stop any active application servers using the stopServer command. To see which application servers are active use the serverStatus command. \n    2. Enter the following command to launch the installation program (NOTE: Enter the command on one line):\n   \n    * Windows: PortalServer_root\\update> updatePortal.bat -install\n      -installDir \"<PortalServer_root>\"\n      -fix\n      -fixDir \"<PortalServer_root>\\update\\fixes\"\n      -fixes < Cumulative fix > \n    * Unix\/Linux: PortalServer_root\/update> .\/updatePortal.sh -install\n      -installDir \"<PortalServer_root>\"\n      -fix\n      -fixDir \"<PortalServer_root>\/update\/fixes\"\n      -fixes < Cumulative fix > \n    * IBM i: portal_server_root\/update> updatePortal.sh -install\n      -installDir \"<portal_server_root>\"\n      -fix\n      -fixDir \"<portal_server_root>\/update\/fixes\"\n      -fixes < Cumulative fix > \n    * z\/OS: If the Health Checker Tool for WebSphere Portal V7.0 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27020200] has not been run then it needs to be run before installing the Combined Cumulative Fix. Execute the following commands to install the Combined Cumulative Fix:  1. From <was_profile_root>\/bin directory:\n          . .\/setupCmdLine.sh \n       2. PortalServer_root\/update> .\/updatePortal.sh -install\n          -installDir \"<PortalServer_root>\"\n          -fix\n          -fixDir \"<PortalServer_root>\/update\/fixes\"\n          -fixes <Cumulative fix>\n          \n          Alternatively, the steps i. and ii. above can be executed via JCL. Customize the JCL samples from the following link: Installing interim fixes on WebSphere Portal Enable for z\/OS using Portal Update Installer [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21326670]. Submit the JCLs, and then return here to continue.\n          \n      \n      \n   \n   If you do not have any profiles at this point (because you are in the process of migration from WebSphere Portal 6.1 or Installing an additional node for a cluster or creating multiple profiles) no post installation steps are necessary and you can continue with the next steps that create the profiles as outlined by the according documentation.\n   \n   z\/OS: If doing an upgrade as part of a migration from a previous version (eg. 6.x), run .\/ConfigEngine.sh gather-migration-files command from the <wp_profile_root>\/ConfigEngine directory.\n   \n   z\/OS: Run the following command: <wp_profile_root>\/PortalServer\/bin\/UpdateProfile.sh install CF skipPreCheckProfile\n   \n   All other platforms: To update a profile after an upgrade, the following command can be used to update profiles that are not included in AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles. All profiles that were not included in AutoUpdateMultipleProfiles need to be updated after the upgrade is done. All profiles must be at the same level for future upgrades to be applied. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http:\/\/www-10.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].\n   \n   <wp_profile_root>\/PortalServer\/bin\/UpdateProfile.bat|.sh install CF\n   \n   This cumulative fix provides updates to OSGi bundles. After installing the cumulative fix, run \"<profile location>\/bin\/osgiCfgInit.sh\" (for IBM i the command is just osgiCfgInit, for Microsoft Windows the command is osgiCfgInit.bat) to clear the caches and make the OSGi container pick up the updates to the modified OSGi bundles. Note that it is recommended to stop the portal server before running the osgiCfgInit command. \n * \n * \n\n3. Perform the following post installation steps: \n *  If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server and you are using the WebSphere Application Server automatic generation and propagation of the plugin, then just restart the Web server. If you are not using the automatic generation and propagation, then perform the following steps:\n    1. Regenerate the Web server plugin. \n    2. Copy the plugin-cfg.xml file to the Plugin directory. \n    3. Restart the Web server.\n       \n   \n   Redeploy your customization, including JSPs, to the WCM portlets if you are using Web Content Manager and you customized the portlets prior to installing the Combined Cumulative fix.  1. To update the deployed remote rendering portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory \n        * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator \n        * Navigate to: Administration \/ Portlet Management \/ Web Modules \n        * Find and select the remote rendering portlet web module \n        * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet \n        * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>\/PortalServer\/wcm\/prereq.wcm\/installableApps \n        * Click Next and Finish\n       \n       \n    2. To update the deployed PDM Doc List Portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory \n        * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator \n        * Navigate to: Administration \/ Portlet Management \/ Web Modules \n        * Find and select the PDM Doc List Portlet web module \n        * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet \n        * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>\/PortalServer\/wcm\/prereq.wcm\/installableApps \n        * Click Next and Finish\n       \n       \n    3. Log out of Portal for changes to take effect.\n   \n   Clear the browser cache before using the updated Web Content Manager. Review the following documentation \"Configuration Changes and Options introduced in WP\/WCM V7.0.0.1 and 7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fixes\" [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27021250] to see if it applies to your environment.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteps for uninstalling Combined Cumulative Fix \n\nNOTE: Changing the server context root after upgrading is an unsupported uninstall path. To uninstall after changing the context root, you must first change the server context root back to the values of the previous version. \n\nNOTE: Configuring Portal Server from a stand-alone environment to a cluster environment after upgrading is an unsupported uninstall path. \n\n 1. Perform the following steps before you uninstall the Combined Cumulative Fix:  1. If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server, stop the Web server. \n     2. Verify that the information in the wkplc.properties, wkplc_dbdomain.properties, wkplc_dbtype.properties, and wkplc_comp.properties files are correct. If using multiple profiles, also verify that the information in each profile is correct. See the following link for multiple profiles Supporting multiple profiles: wp7 [http:\/\/www-10.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Supporting_multiple_profiles_wp7].  * Enter a value for the PortalAdminPwd and WasPassword parameters in the wkplc.properties file. \n         * Ensure that the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters are defined correctly for all database domains in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. \n         * If using a database other than the default, grant permissions to databases within the framework by setting the DbUser (database user) and DbPassword (database password) parameters in the wkplc_dbdomain.properties file. \n         * Unix\/Linux\/Windows\/IBM i Only: The WebSphere Portal Update Installer removes plain text passwords from the wkplc*.properties files. To keep these passwords in the properties files, include the following line in the wkplc.properties file: PWordDelete=false. \n         * Ensure that the value of the XmlAccessPort property in wkplc_comp.properties matches the value of the port used for HTTP connections to the WebSphere Portal server. \n         * WebSphere Portal 7 introduced support for multiple profiles. During the Combined Cumulative Fix uninstall the primary profile is downgraded first if one exists (The Update Installer also supports the update case for a binary only install without profiles). The primary profile is identified by two properties, ProfileDirectory and ProfileName. Ensure these properties are set before starting the downgrade process. \n         * If using Multiple Profiles, verify all your profiles are at the same level before starting downgrade.\n           \n        \n        \n    \n    \n 2. Choose either the graphical user interface uninstallation option or the command line uninstallation option:\n    \n    NOTE: Not all platforms can use the graphical user interface (IBM i and z\/OS can only use command line).\n    \n    NOTE: If the uninstallation fails, use the IBM Support Assistant [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/support\/isa\/] to access support-related information and serviceability tools for problem determination.

If you are running an external Web server such as IBM HTTP server and you are using the WebSphere Application Server automatic generation and propagation of the plugin, then just restart the Web server. If you are not using the automatic generation and propagation, then perform the following steps:  1. Regenerate the Web server plugin. \n     2. Copy the plugin-cfg.xml file to the Plugin directory. \n     3. Restart the Web server.\n    \n    \n 5. If you previously customized any configuration files in the wp_profile_root\/PortalServer\/config directory, check to see if uninstalling the cumulative fix affected those files by restoring a version of the files that was saved when the cumulative fix was originally installed. If it did affect the files, you must perform the same customization on the restored version of each file. \n 6. Redeploy your customization, including JSPs, to the WCM portlets if you are using Web Content Manager and you customized the portlets prior to uninstalling the Combined Cumulative fix.  1.

To update the deployed PDM Doc List Portlet:  * Backup any files (e.g. custom JSPs) which have been copied to the deployed remote rendering portlet WAR directory \n         * Log in to Portal as the Portal Administrator \n         * Navigate to: Administration \/ Portlet Management \/ Web Modules \n         * Find and select the PDM Doc List Portlet web module \n         * Click the Update Portlet Icon to the right of the selected portlet \n         * Select the updated portlet WAR file located in: <PortalServer_root>\/PortalServer\/wcm\/prereq.wcm\/installableApps \n         * Click Next and Finish\n        \n        \n     3. Log out of Portal for changes to take effect.\n    \n    \n 7. Clear the browser cache before using the updated Web Content Manager.\n\n\n\n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown issues for latest Combined Cumulative Fix \n\n\nProblem: There may be browser \/ functional issues in themes and in WCM when running 7002 CF levels against Internet Explorer 11 or Microsoft Edge. \nSolution: It is recommended to run these browsers in compatibility mode as necessary. Also, note that some pieces of WCM functionality (exs. inability to close Workflow dialogs, Applet issues) may not work correctly with these browsers even in compatibility mode as they are not supported. \n\nProblem: Inline help may not appear correctly after CF29 update on zOS. \nSolution: From the <wp_profile_root>\/ConfigEngine directory, run task \n\n.\/ConfigEngine.sh expand-ear-wp.iehs.ear \n\nThen restart the Portal server. \n\n\nProblem: When using versions earlier than 'Java 6 update 45' or 'Java 7 update 51', a security pop-up dialog or error will be seen every time the WCM FileTransferApplet or Ephox EditLive editor is instantiated. \nSolution: It is recommended to upgrade the Java runtime environment level to either 'Java 6 update 45' or 'Java 7 update 51' or later. Please refer to the following URL: swg21663838 \n\n\nProblem: After you enter a number into the number element\/component, and then save the content\/component more than twice, you will notice that the number field gets populated with some dots, i.e. 123.456.78. If you then click on Save again, you will get the following error: \n'Enter a valid number. ( content\/component name here)' \nSolution: The workaround is to remove the dots and save again. \n\n\nProblem: Page theme is changed to current Portal default theme when changing page content layout. \nSolution: The workaround would be to change the page theme back to \"Inherit Parent Theme\". A fix for this issue is scheduled to be included in a future Combined CF. \n\n\nProblem: After upgrading to a 7.0.0.2 Cumulative Fix and \"Portal 7.0.0.2\" theme has been set as the default portal theme, a user is unable to post to a blog or update a wiki using Microsoft Windows Internet Explorer. \nSolution: Perform the following steps to resolve the issue:  1. Navigate to Administration -> Manage Pages -> Contenet_Root -> Hidden pages. \n 2. Select \"Edit Page Properties\" for the hidden page named 'Web Content Management'. \n 3. On the 'Edit page: Web Content Management' page, extend 'Theme:' drop-down list and select \"-----Inherit Parent Theme-----\".\n\n\n\nProblem: WCM Authoring Search may not work after an upgrade to a 7.0.0.2 Cumulative Fix \nSolution: Perform the following steps to resolve the issue:  1. Edit the <wp_profile>\/PortalServer\/jcr\/lib\/com\/ibm\/icm\/icm.properties file in a text editor to verify all properties are correct. \n 2. Set jcr.textsearch.enabled=true \n 3. Change jcr.textsearch.indexdirectory to a corresponding location in the filesystem \n 4. Restart your Portal Server. \n 5. Create a new library or make changes in existing libraries\n\n\n\nProblem: When configuring Portal for use with a remote DB2 on z\/OS database, the sample job provided for the database creation does not contain the statements required to create the storage groups. These take the form: \n\nCREATE STOGROUP group \nVOLUMES(' volume') \nVCAT category; \nCOMMIT; \n\nwhere, \ngroup is the name of the storage group for the database, \nvolume is the volume serial number of * to let SMS select the volume where the database will reside, \ncategory is the category name of the Integrated Catalog Facility. \n\nSolution: When using the EJPSCRDB sample job add the above statements for each storage group to the final version. These should be added at the beginning of \"Step 2\" of the sample job, just before the CREATE statements for the actual databases. \n\n\nProblem: Theme Policies are not supported by the Portal 7.0.0.2 theme. \nSolution: This is a known limitation. \n\n\nProblem: Client-side aggregation is not supported by the Portal 7.0.0.2 theme. \nSolution: This is a known limitation. \n\n\nProblem: The WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.2 theme does not support Sametime 8.5.1 \nSolution: This is a known limitation. \n\n\nProblem: Loading a page with the out of box default profile (Deferred) causes \"dojo is not defined\" error. \nSolution: Dojo is not available in view mode using the Deferred profile, which is the default out of box. Switch the page or theme to use the Full profile to access Dojo in view mode. For more information see URL: http:\/\/www.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Creating_the_module_profile_sdoc [http:\/\/www.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Creating_the_module_profile_sdoc] \n\n\nProblem: The Portal 7.0.0.2 drag-and-drop framework does not support multi-selection and copying resources. \nSolution: This is a known limitation. This can be enabled by creating a custom drag and drop source and enabling these features. \n\n\nProblem: The deploy-7002-theme task fails \nSolution: The Portal 7.0.0.2 theme requires several artifacts from the \"Page Builder\" theme to exist on the server. If you have removed the theme or if you are coming from a migrated environment where the theme never existed, you will need to add the Page Builder theme back to the system before running the deploy-7002-theme task. Please see the \"Additional instructions for a migrated environment\" section at the following URL for more information http:\/\/www.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Installing_a_new_theme_sdoc [http:\/\/www.lotus.com\/ldd\/portalwiki.nsf\/dx\/Installing_a_new_theme_sdoc] \n\n\nProblem: The Feedspace portlet in Portal 7.0.0.2 may show JavaScript issues. \nSolution: The Feedspace portlet needs to be redeployed to resolve this. Use the Portal administration area to update the the SyndicatedFeedPortlet.war. Use the PortalServer\/bp\/wp.bp.feedspace\/installableApps\/SyndicatedFeedPortlet.war to do this update. \n\n\nProblem: If a WCM cumulative fix is installed on a Websphere Portal 7.0.0.2 where the date of the install is later than the date on which the cumulative fix was packaged, then the update-wcm task will fail to overwrite the WCM war files from the base version. \nSolution: To workaround this problem, the war files from [PortalServer]\\wcm\\prereq.wcm\\installableApps have to be manually copied to [PortalServer]\\installableApps. Once this is done, the update-wcm task will execute successfully. \n\n\nProblem: Newly added WCM libraries might not be listed in the \"Web Content Libraries\" portlet on all nodes of the cluster due to an issue in cache replication. \nSolution: The workaround would be to restart nodes which have the stale library list. A fix for this issue is scheduled to be included in a future Combined CF. \n\n\nProblem: After uninstall of the combined cumulative fix, WPVersionInfo shows IBM WebSphere Portal Configuration Framework (CFGFW) at the upgraded version level. \nSolution: This is expected. The CFGFW version level shown after the uninstall of the combined cumulative fix remains at the upgraded level. There is no functional problem. \n\n\nProblem: If you plan to configure Computer Associates eTrust SiteMinder as your external security manager to handle authorization and authentication, the XML configuration interface may not be able to access WebSphere Portal through eTrust SiteMinder. \nSolution: To enable the XML configuration interface to access WebSphere Portal, use eTrust SiteMinder to define the configuration URL (\/wps\/config) as unprotected. Refer to the eTrust SiteMinder documentation for specific instructions. After the configuration URL is defined as unprotected, only WebSphere Portal enforces access control to this URL. Other resources such as the \/wps\/myportal URL are still protected by eTrust SiteMinder. If you already set up eTrust SiteMinder for external authorization and you want to use XMLConfiguration Interface (xmlaccess), make sure you have followed the procedure to allow for xmlaccess execution. \n\n\nProblem: If using the Firefox browser, portlets cannot be dragged to a page from the palette. It is necessary to click the + icon next to the portlet in the palette to add it to the page. \nSolution: This is documented as a known limitation. \n\n\nProblem: If an error is seen starting server \"WebSphere_Portal\" during the upgrade, a possible cause is that this server start is automatically enabled as part of the node reset state. \nThe error would appear similar to the following as part of the \"action-start-portal-server-standard\" task : \"ADMU3027E: An instance of the server may already be running: WebSphere_Portal\" \nSolution: Log into the WAS Admin Console. Under Application Servers-> WebSphere_Portal, ensure that the Monitoring Policy for \"Node restart state\" is set to Stopped for all WebSphere Portal servers that are part of the environment. \n\n\nFor a list of known issues for Previous WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fixes, see IBM WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.2 Combined Cumulative Fix Previous Known Issues [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27023912]for details. \n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information \nYou can find additional information on the WebSphere Portal support page [http:\/\/www-306.ibm.com\/software\/genservers\/portal\/support\/]. \n\nBack to top \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrademarks and service marks \nFor trademark attribution, visit the IBM Terms of Use [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/legal\/us\/] Web site. \n\nBack to top",

By resolving the memory constraints, the stack overflow can be resolved. \nCAUSE\nWhen a stack overflow occurs, the amount of stack space required by the program exceeds what is configured for the stack in the Java™ Virtual Machine (JVM) process, or the native stack size configured by the operating system. \nSome applications require stacks that are larger than the default size; for example, a graphics-intensive Java program can require a larger stack, which may require an increase in the stack size to avoid StackOverflow.\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nLook for either Out of Memory messages or java.lang.StackOverflow in the server logs. The process may continue to run after either of these messages are seen. \n\n\nIf a crash did occur, a javacore should have generated on IBM SDK. You will either see the signal as SIGSEGV, SIGILL, SIGABRT, or SIGBUS. Usually the current thread will indicate the following\n\n\n\n\npending=java.lang.StackOverflowError \nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&aid=1]Explanations and Solutions\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=2]Detailed Configuration Options \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nExplanations and Solutions \n\nInfinite Recursion \nIf an application is performing recursion, the maximum stack size can easily be reached and a Stack Overflow exception is thrown. The thread stack has a limited size and eventually its space will run out as the thread stack grows without bounds. \n\nSome traits of recursion: \n- Large thread stacks that appear to repeat \n- An infinite loop that continuously spawns off threads \n- Very large XML documents loaded into the Document Object Model (DOM) \n- JSP or servlets calling itself (usually by executing forward or include to itself) \n- Repeated calls in native functions \n\nIncreasing the thread stack size allows for larger thread stacks. However if the recursion continues to trigger a stack overflow, the next step is to identify what code is causing the recursion from javacores, thread dumps, or even system core files. \n\nA thread stack that indicates it's too large to display can be an indicator of stack overflow. This is especially true if the stack appears to repeat (such as recursive method calls). \n\nJIT\/HotSpot Compiled Code \n\nThe JIT\/HotSpot compiler (JIT) is designed to speed up the JVM execution times by compiling method calls. This can speed up execution time, but as more aggressive optimizations are used, this can inadvertently cause recursion, resulting in stack overflow or crash. The documents linked below explain how to debug JIT and HotSpot compiler issues:  * JIT Problem Determination for IBM SDK 5.0 and 6.0 using -Xjit [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21294023] \n * Debugging HotSpot failures on the Solaris and HP-UX operating environment [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?rs=0&uid=swg21081179]\n\n\n\nDepleted Native Stack \nIt is almost guaranteed that a crash will occur if the native stack runs out of space. System cores can be used to identify long and possibly recursively looping native thread stacks. \n\nTo resolve, increase the native stack size (usually by adjusting the operating system limit for stack size) to accommodate the recursive native calls; however, identifying the recursive native calls will help determine the root cause of the stack overflow. \n\n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21162896&amp;aid=3] Back to top \n\n[http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/i\/v14\/rules\/dotted_blue_rule_443.gif] \n\n \n\nDetailed Configuration Options \n\nAdjusting the Stack Sizes (Xss and Xmso) options \nIf this does not work, you can adjust the stack sizes. Doubling the stack size is suggested as a first step; however, every thread that the JVM creates will consume memory. Be careful to not exhaust your physical and heap memory resources. \n\nFor every Java thread, there are two stacks that are utilized. One is for Java code for method calls, and the other is for native C code (on Solaris and HP-UX, only the native stack is utilized). These are adjustable and can be raised to provide more room on the stacks to prevent an overflow. \n\n * Maximum Thread Stack Size (-Xss)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xss<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * there is no distinction between native and thread stack sizes\n * \n * only \n * \n * HP-UX\n * \n * \n * \n *  -XX:MainThreadStackSize=<size> \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Initial Thread Stack Size (-Xiss)\n * \n * This is only for distributed platforms (AIX, Linux, Windows)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xiss<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Initial Native Stack Size (-Xmso)\n * \n * This is only for distributed platforms (AIX, Linux, Windows)\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n *  -Xmso<size> \n * \n * <size>\n * \n * nn[k|m|g|K|M|G]\n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\n\nDefault Values \nThis is a chart of default sizes for the various stack size arguments.

This error almost always means that the policy did not receive any data. If you increase the logging from error to debug, you should see network failures surrounding the response header error.\n\n\n\nIn almost every event, this error is caused by a connection failure.\nThe error is correct, the service did not receive any response headers or data. The key to help confirm this is to increase the log level to debug. This will allow you to see the network debug errors around the context of the service error.\n\n\nANSWER\nThe classic causes of this are either of these two: \n\n\n\n \n\nA slow response that causes the connection to timeout before receiving the response\nA failed connection attempt due to a closed persistent connection or some other connection issue that prevents the WebSphere® DataPower device® from connecting to the backend. For example, a reused connection would be attempted and found to already be closed out by something outside of DataPower®.\nAn example of this is explained here:\nhttp:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934&wv=1 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21417934&wv=1]\n\nThere are a broad range of network errors that can trigger this to error. A packet trace is the key to capture the problem and confirm what type of failure is the cause. A log with event subscription of \"all\" \"debug\" will also help correlate and confirm the packet trace data.\n\nIn some cases, a simple work around to try is to lower the DataPower persistent timeout or disable persistent connections. If this does not prevent the problem, then analysis of the packet trace and error report are required.",

It may be necessary to return the appliance to IBM for repair.\nThe reinit CLI command will allow you to reconfigure an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance. The reinit CLI command will allow you to delete (not erase) all existing configuration and data from an IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA appliance.\n\nWhen the reinitialize command completes, your network IP configurations, user accounts and other configuration options, are no longer accessible. \n\nYou will only be able to connect to the appliance using the serial connection. \n\nYou will need to configure your Ethernet and all other settings again using the information in the product information center available from our library page [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/datapower\/library\/index.html].\n\nImportant points: \n\n * Make sure you have a working serial connection to the appliance. \n   \n   \n * The admin password will revert to the initial value of \"admin\" after the command executes.\n   \n   \n * A firmware image must be on the appliance prior to running the command. The firmware image used for the last upgrade of the device is removed from the file system automatically when the device reboots. Use DataPower's File Management WebGUI option to confirm you have an image or use these CLI commands:\n   xi52# configure\n   xi52# dir image:\n   If an image file is not found, you will need to load a firmware image to the appliance into the image:\/\/\/ directory. For example: you can use the WebGUI file management options or from the Control Panel, choose the System Control icon, the under Boot Image, choose the firmware file upload options.\n   \n   \n * Use the DataPower File Management to confirm you have sufficient file space. If you don't have sufficient file space, you can delete domains or other files to free up file space to allow the firmware image to be loaded to the appliance. \n   \n   \n * reinit is a CLI command available in the config-flash# mode, for example:\n   \n   xi52# configure terminal\n   Global configuration mode \n   xi52(config)# flash \n   Flash configuration mode \n   xi52(config-flash)#\n   reinit <filename> \n   \n   Where <filename> represents a firmware image contained within the image:\/\/\/ directory. This will be the firmware image which will be installed during the reinit process. For more CLI commands, refere to the following doc link:\n   http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wsdatap\/v5r0m0\/nav\/4_4 [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wsdatap\/v5r0m0\/nav\/4_4] \n   \n   \n * After the appliance reboots:  *  If the firmware image used was for V5 or newer, you will need to accept the license at first logon to the WebGui Configure the appliance per the instructions in the appliances configuration guide. This and other documentation on the appliance is available from our library page [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/datapower\/library\/index.html]. \n   \n   \n\n\n\nThe command is documented in the information center. This and other documentation on the appliance is available from our library page [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/datapower\/library\/index.html]. \n\nIf your appliance has the optional RAID (hard drives) reinitialize the RAID using the information in our RAID technote [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21358544]. \n\nIf your appliance has the optional HSM, reinitialize the HSM following the instructions in our HSM book or infocenter for your release of the product. These are available on our library page [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/datapower\/library\/documentation\/].  \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM DataPower Gateway Virtual Edition Business Integration IBM DataPower Gateways",

It is strongly recommended to review the platform information on IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/prodguid\/v1r0\/clarity\/index.jsp]. The installation of IBM SPSS Statistics software on Apple Macintosh OSX operating systems requires an Intel processor. \n\nA) Apple Macintosh MacOS High Sierra (10.13) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 only. Please note that no other SPSS release will be officially supported on High Sierra, but older versions like SPSS Statistics 24 may run as well on High Sierra. \n\nNOTE: There's a known issue with some of the earlier release of Mac High Sierra system (13.0 and 13.1 beta version). \nThe top menu of SPSS 25 may disappear if the Mac OS system is set to Non-English. \nThe official MacOSX 10.13.1 version do not have this issue. So, if you encountert this issue you need to update your Mac OS version to latest official 10.13.1 build from Apple. \n\n \n\nB) Apple Macintosh MacOS Sierra (10.12) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and IBM SPSS Statistics 24 only. For release 24 It is also recommended to install the latest FixPack 2 for release 24 on Mac [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24043574]. [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24042675] \n\nNo older SPSS Statistics releases are supported on Sierra. \n\n \n\nC) Apple Macintosh OSX El Capitan (10.11) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Please see the Release notes - IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27047057] for known issues on Macintosh. \n\nFull documentation including installation material provided in different languages and manuals for release 24 can be found on IBM SPSS Statistics 24 Documentation [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27047033] webpage. \n\n \n\nAlso, Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23.

If you like to use Statistics 22 on Yosemite you need to install Statistics 22 Fixpack 2 as well. Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and release Statistics 23 are fully tested on Yosemite OSX 10.10. So if you like to run Statistics 22 on Yosemite please install Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and also read the section below: \n\n**** \n\nIn some instances it can be necessary to re-install the legacy Apple Java 6 on 10.10 for the use of Statistics 22 FixPack 2 on this platform\n\nDownload and re-install Apple Java 6 \n\n- After you upgraded your Apple Mac OSX from a previous release to 10.10, Apple Java 6 may no longer exists on your upgraded system. If you then launch Statistics 22 which is an application that relies on Java 6, it can happen, the Mac OS pops up a dialog box stating Java 6 was requested, but none is present.\n- The Java dialog has a \"More Info\" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided:\nhttp:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/dl1572 [http:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/dl1572]\n- Click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.\n- Then you open the Java DMG, double click on the Java installer, follow the prompts and complete the installation of Java 6.\n\n******* \n\n \n\nE) Apple Macintosh OSC Mavericks (10.9) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 \n\n*** \n\nNote: IBM SPSS Statistics 22 was developed and released prior to Apple's release of OS X 10.9 (Mavericks).

Typically, this is accomplished by a deployment tool that is specific to the application server. It generates code to allow your EJB to run within an EJB container. Some application server products' deployment tools alter the bytecode of your application classes rather than generating code ;however, the end result is similar. \n\nThe EJBDeploy Tool \n\nHistorically, EJB deployment in the Application Server product has been performed by the EJBDeploy tool, which is included with WebSphere® Application Server and packaged with the development tools for the WebSphere products. \nThe EJBDeploy tool inspects the external interfaces for your enterprise beans, generates wrapper code as .java files, and compiles the code using the javac compiler. The resulting .class files are packaged in your EJB module with your application code. For modules including and previous to EJB 2.1, the EJBDeploy tool must be invoked manually. \nPlease note that in WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.x and below, the tool can only deploy Java EE applications compiled with a JDK level of 7 or below.

In addition, some related functions in the user interface might not work or might generate exceptions when accessed. Clicking buttons in the authoring portlet may generate the following error in the log: \n\n * \n * IWKAP0009E: Servlet not enabled\n * \n\n\nIf this occurs, you must re-enable these features manually after migration. \nCAUSE\nThe migration process can disable some new out-of-the-box features if the feature did not exist in the previous release or if it was updated. In particular, the Portal page required for the reserved authoring portlet is missing and the permissions on the AJAX proxy servlet are not set correctly.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo re-enable the affected features manually after migration, do the following: \n\n\n1. Make sure that the page on which the WCM authoring portlet is installed uses a theme with client-side rendering such as the Page Builder theme.\n\n2. Deploy the hidden Portal page on which the reserved authoring portlet is installed. \n\n\n3.

    "reference_doc": "IBM After restoring BigFix server database, ILMT\/BFI\/SUA server may not import all the data since the restore correctly - United States\n\nsequance number; resotre; database; missing data; gap TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nTHIS DOCUMENT APPLIES ONLY TO THE FOLLOWING LANGUAGE VERSION(S):\n English \n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n After you restore the BigFix database and run an import, new data is not displayed in BFI\/SUA\/LMT even after successful ETL imports. \n\nSYMPTOM\nNot all data reported already by endpoints to BigFix server are visible in LMT\/BFI console. This may include scan results, capacity data, etc.\n\n\nCAUSE\nBFI\/SUA\/LMT is designed to import only newly created data. To achieve this, the data is marked with the so-called sequence number. The sequence number is incremented during every change, upload, scan, etc. Every import contains data starting from the sequence number reported during the last successful import to the current sequence number. \n\nWhen the database is restored, the sequence number is restored to the value from the time when the database backup was created. Because of that, it might happen that the sequence number after the restoration is lower than the sequence number reported during the last successful import. In such case, the first import after the database restoration does not include any data. After that import, the sequence number is updated and the next import contains new data. Depending on your scan settings, you might need to wait some time for the import that contains new data. \n\nWhen the database is restored, the sequence number is restored to the value from the time when the database backup was created.\n\nData for the period from the last successful import before the restoration of the database until the restoration is never imported (obviously, as the data was removed by restoring the DB) and needs to be re-generated by re-running the scans if needed. \n\nData from DB restoration time until first successful import is also by default not imported (causing a gap). To cover this gap you may follow the procedure described below.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWarning: The following procedure will impact the length of the first import after the sequence is reset. After performing below steps ALL DATA from all endpoints available on BigFix server side will be imported (not only covering the problematic gap). For big environments the impact may be huge and it is better to re-run scans on selected endpoints instead.\n\n1) Ensure that the import is not running and stop the BFI\/SUA\/LMT server.\n2) To reset the sequence for all data sources and import all data, run the following query on the BFI\/SUA\/LMT database:\n\nDB2:\nUPDATE dbo.DATASOURCE_SEQUENCES set LAST_SEQUENCE = blob(x'0000000000000000');\n\nMSSQL:\nUPDATE dbo.datasource_sequences set last_sequence = 0x0000000000000000;\n\n3) Start the BFI\/SUA\/LMT. \n4) Run an import.\n\n \n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Security IBM BigFix Inventory",

    "reference_doc": "IBM HTTP Session time-out settings and overwrite precedence rules - United States\n\nWebSphere http session management time-out wasrun precedence overwrite TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n It is possible to set the HTTP Session time-out in various places on the IBM® WebSphere® Application Server Administrative Console. It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. \n\nSince Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. \n\nCAUSE\nApplication needs HTTP session time-out set.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: \n\n * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels \n * At the time when the application is packaged \n * In the application code\n\n\nSetting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console \n1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. \n\n\n2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. \n\n\n3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n          <session-config> \n      *          <session-timeout>60<\/session-timeout>\n * \n *       <\/session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. \n\nHTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary \n\nThe list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. \n\n1.

You can switch it back to HTTP. \n\nDOWNLOAD DESCRIPTION\nWhen Business Process Choreographer Explorer uses the default secure HTTPS protocol, any attempts to access Business Process Choreographer Explorer using HTTP are redirected to use HTTPS. If you need Business Process Choreographer Explorer to support insecure HTTP connections, you can use the unsecureExplorer.ant script to switch the protocol used from HTTPS to HTTP. \n\nAttention: It is not recommend to use the insecure HTTP protocol. Using HTTP for the Business Process Choreographer Explorer can open your organization to possible security problems.\n\nSwitching to HTTP\n\nIf you need to switch Business Process Choreographer Explorer from HTTPS to use HTTP, complete the following actions: \n\n 1. Download the unsecureExplorer.ant script file, which is attached near the bottom of this page.\n    \n    \n 2. If you previously switched Business Process Choreographer Explorer to use HTTP, but are performing this task again because you are installing an interim fix, fix pack, or refresh pack that updated Business Process Choreographer Explorer has reverted it back to the default HTTPS protocol, you must first delete the old (invalid) backup EAR file before running the script.\n    \n     * On Linux, UNIX-based and z\/OS platforms, delete the install_root\/ProcessChoreographer\/internal\/bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear file. \n     * On Microsoft Windows platforms, delete the\n       install_root\\ProcessChoreographer\\internal\\bpcexplorer_secure_backup.ear file.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 3.

If that happens and you still need the Business Process Choreographer Explorer to use the HTTP protocol, you must complete these steps again to re-enable the HTTP protocol. \n\n\n\nSwitching back to HTTPS \n\nIf you need to switch Business Process Choreographer Explorer back from HTTP to HTTPS, complete the following actions:  1. Change to the directory where the backup EAR file is located.  * On Linux, UNIX-based and z\/OS platforms, its location is \n       install_root\/ProcessChoreographer\/internal \n     * On Windows platforms, its location is \n       install_root\\ProcessChoreographer\\internal\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 2.

The default BPM85 typical installation installs ProcessCenter Quickstart web page for starting the Dmgr and NodeMgr servers using the installation admin user . However, logout stops the services started by and attached to the admin user. I need to have this ProcessCenter (and Deployment Env Process SErvers) BPM85 DMgr \/ Node\/ WASND started as a managed Windows managed service. I didn't see a Service Definition page to select run as Windows service.

This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. \n\nCAUSE\nThe DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. \n\nIt should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events. First, this example shows how to create the log target sending events to a syslog destination. The other examples listed below will have their own strong points to be considered depending on the problem scenario. \n\n \n\nSyslog: \n\n* The syslog protocol operates over UDP which has no guarantee on packet delivery - a fast fire and forget method. \n\nTo create the new log target, go into the default domain: Objects > Log Targets \n\nConfigure the log target with settings as follows from the WebGUI: \n\n 1. Name the log target \n 2. Select Target Type of syslog \n 3. Fill in the Local Identifier with a descriptive string that may be used by a remote recipient to identify this specific log target \n 4. Enter the Remote Host Address and the Remote IP Port as in the screen shot wherex.x.x.x is the IP address of the remote syslog server that listens on port 514 \n 5. Take all other defaults\n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1]  \n\n \n\nUnder the Event Subscriptions tab, you can select all and debug as indicated here: \n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] \n\n * \n * 6. Generate log events in the DataPower by using some transactions, for example by saving the configuration from the WebGUI or running some test load into a domain.\n\n\nSyslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. \n\n \n\nNFS:\nAll NFS limitations apply from file size and permission settings. This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. \n\n \n\nFile type: \n\nUsing a file type log target with a backup method as seen here:\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3]\nThis will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. This will upload with a unique time and date stamp on the uploaded file.\n\nThis is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load.\n\n\nHTTP service:\nFinally a clever method that may be used in some senarios would be an HTTP service on the device.\nUsing an HTTP service configured in the following way,\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] \n\nOnce the file type log is created in the logtemp:\/\/\/ directory, a client browser or wget type client can easily retrieve the file from the device. \n\nThis is very useful when there is no local or accessible remote log storage location to the device, due to firewall or network restrictions. \n\nThis is also removing the limitation of the device dropping the log event should it not be able to write the log event to the network. \n\nEach of the above methods are very useful and work better in some scenarios than others depending on the network, load, problem, and information needed. This is intended to be a guide to help you decide which method would be best for your scenario.",

The vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in bn_<instanceName>.config will be updated to \nthe same vaule of \"KBN_SOMA_PROTOCOL\" in bn.ini while the instance is re-configured.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n----------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command\nto view the current version of the agent after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer before viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM'.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems -t or\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser>\n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t bn\n\nNote: The component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is\nspecified as two characters (bn), not three characters (kbn).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n07.10.03.00\n\nAfter the agent is restarted, you can also use the GUI to verify\nthat the agent was successfully updated.\n\nFor the agent on Windows systems, the version number is\n07.10.03.00.\nFor the agent on UNIX systems, the version number is\n07.10.03.00.\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly, use the\nkincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on\nLinux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the versions\nof the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems\nafter this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote: The date shown for the build might not be accurate.

When you install application support on the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, you are installing the files required for presenting workspaces and online help for each monitoring agent. When you install application support on the hub monitoring server, you are installing the files required for product-provided situations, situation distributions, and other product-specific data. Installing application support on the hub monitoring server is also known as \"seeding\" the hub.\nMost z\/OS-based agents provide application support files on CDs or DVDs, which are separate from the mainframe installation media. Distributed agents include their application support files in the distributed installation process. Each CD \/DVD that contains application support files is listed below, with information about which products use the CD \/DVD and where the CD \/ DVD can be found. The latest level in fulfillment is the CD \/DVD on this list. Where possible, IBM provides both .zip and .tar formats, as well as .iso format, so that a physical CD \/ DVD can be created.\n\nPlease note that the IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) media is separate from the workspace application support files which are included with products that run in the ITM environment. ITM can be obtained by ordering either 5724-C04 IBM Tivoli Monitoring through Passport Advantage or the no charge 5698-A79 IBM Tivoli Management Services on z\/OS through Shop zSeries. Your IBM rep can ask Techline to configure and submit the order as well. 5698-A79 includes the server, engine, and configurator on z\/OS.

You try now:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) ACTION(REMOVE)\n19 : SET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER(testuser) ACTION(REMOVE)\n\nBut you get the following error:\n\nAMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.\n\nYou specified the attribute CLNTUSER(testuser) as it was shown in the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH(*), thus, you think the record should be found. You want to know what is the problem?\n\n\nCAUSE\nSee the following section of the MQ 7.1 documentation:\nWebSphere MQ > Administering > Administering local WebSphere MQ objects > Performing local administration tasks using MQSC commands\nWebSphere MQ object names [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_7.1.0\/com.ibm.mq.doc\/fa11060_.htm]\n+ Case-sensitivity in MQSC commands\nMQSC commands, including their attributes, can be written in upper-case or lower-case. Object names in MQSC commands are folded to upper-case (that is, QUEUE and queue are not differentiated), unless the names are enclosed within single quotation marks. If quotation marks are not used, the object is processed with a name in upper-case. \n\nWhen specifying the SET command with the following value CLNTUSER(testuser) the string 'testuser' will be folded to upper-case resulting in the following value being actually used by runmqsc:\nCLNTUSER(TESTUSER)\nAnd in this case, there is no record for the user TESTUSER (the record is for 'testuser').\n\n\nANSWER\nNOTICE that the userid mentioned in the CLNTUSER field of the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH command is NOT surrounded by single quotes. \n\nHowever, you MUST include the single quotes when specifying the value during an ACTION(REMOVE):\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\n1 : set CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\n\n++ Example of record with more attributes\n\nLet's examine the case when a record has more attributes, such as:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(ADD)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\ndisplay CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\n9 : display CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP)\nDESCR( ) CUSTOM( )\nADDRESS(*) CLNTUSER(client_1)\nMCAUSER(user_1) USERSRC(MAP)\n\nYou want to delete the record and you try the following command which is based on the command that worked well for a simpler case. But this time, it fails:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.\n\nYou try the original command that created the record, but changing the action to REMOVE:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8885: Parameter not allowed for this action on a channel authentication record.\n\nThe attribute USERSRC is not a valid parameter for the REMOVE action (see table below).\nTherefore, by removing this attribute, then the following command worked successfully to remove the record:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('mengano') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE) \nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\nSee:\nWebSphere MQ 8.0.0 > IBM MQ > Reference > Administration reference > MQSC reference > The MQSC commands > \nSET CHLAUTH [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_8.0.0\/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc\/q086630_.htm]\n.\n+ begin excerpt\n.\nUsage notes\nThe following table shows which parameters are valid for each value of ACTION:\n.\nAction \nParameter ADD or REMOVE REMOVEALL\nREPLACE\nCHLAUTH X X X \nTYPE X X X \nCMDSCOPE X X X \nACTION X X X \nADDRESS X X\nADDRLIST X X \nCHCKCLNT X \nCLNTUSER X X \nMCAUSER X \nQMNAME X X \nSSLCERTI X X \nSSLPEER X X \nUSERLIST X X \nUSERSRC X \nWARN X \nDESCR X \n.\n+ end excerpt\n\n\nAdditional Search Words: uppercase lowercase upper lower case\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS\/SYNONYM\n WMQ MQ MQSeries",

During SQL processing it returned: SQL1763N Invalid ALTER TABLESPACE statement for table space \"TEMPSPACE1\" due to reason \"11\" SQLSTATE=429BC \n * \n   \n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nMON_GET_TABLESPACE table function and RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED monitor element can be used to identify whether the tablespace is enabled for reclaimable storage or not. Example: \ndb2 \"SELECT varchar(tbsp_name, 30) as tbsp_name, tbsp_type, RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED FROM TABLE(MON_GET_TABLESPACE('',-2))\" \n\n \n\nSnippet of the output: \n\n \n\nTBSP_NAME TBSP_TYPE RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED\n----------------- ----------- -------------------------\nSYSCATSPACE DMS 1\nTEMPSPACE1 SMS 0\nUSERSPACE1 DMS 1 \n\nIf the RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED monitor element returns a value of 1, then the tablespace is enabled for reclaimable storage. Otherwise, it returns a value of 0.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo use the reclaimable storage feature, make sure to create the DMS or automatic storage tablespaces in DB2 Version 9.7 or later. Example testcase on SYSCATSPACE DMS tablespace which has reclaimable storage enabled. \n\n \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nNote: \nTablespaces migrated from DB2 V9.1\/V9.5 to V9.7 won't get upgraded directly to use the reclaimable storage feature.

Why is the agent issuing this command? \n\nANSWER\nWhen a queue full event occurs, WebSphere MQ will disable the event. To ensure that subsequent queue full events will occur, the OMEGAMON XE for Messaging agent will re-enable the queue full event once it determines the queue is no longer full via an ALTER QL(qname) QDPMAXEV(ENABLED) command. Other than Take Action commands, this is the only ALTER command that the OMEGAMON XE for Messaging agent will issue.",

The value\nthat is displayed is less then the real value. \n\nArchive Node -> Flash Recovery workspace -> \nFlash Recovery Space Usage view\n\nAPAR : IV26915\nAbstract : ORA-12504: TNS:LISTENER WAS NOT GIVEN\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent logs are\nwritten at a rapid pace and growing large very quickly.\nThe following error message repeats:\n\n\"ORA-12504: TNS:listener was not given\".\n\nAPAR : IV30446\nAbstract : ALERT LOG MESSAGE TEXT IS GARBLED\nAdditional Information: The Japanese part of the Oracle alert\nlog message is garbled in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal.\nThis garbled information might also occur in other multi-byte \ncharacter set (MBCS) locales, such as East Asian locales \nsuch as Simplified Chinese or Korean.\n\nAPAR : IV31219\nAbstract : RDB_SESSION_DETAILS WAREHOUSING ERROR 64\nAdditional Information: The historical data from the \nattribute group RDB_Session_Details table cannot be\nexported into the warehouse, because the value after UTF-8\nconversion has a length greater than the column ACTION defined\nwidth (32). Therefore, the row is not exported into\nwarehouse and the local historical data file size \nincreases continuously. This issue might also occur in other\nEast Asian locales such as Simplified Chinese or Korean.\n\nAPAR : IV36395\nAbstract : KRZCLIENT FILE HANDLE LEAK ON WINDOWS\nAdditional Information: \"Handle Count\" on Windows operating systems \nwhere the Oracle Extended Database agent is running is constantly \ngrowing. When the agent is restarted, the krzclient.exe process \nis using hundreds of file handles. The hundreds of file handles \nincreases to thousands of file handles in a few hours.\n\nAPAR : IV38555\nAbstract : KRZCLIENT CRASHES AT TOPSQL\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Extended Database agent krzclient\nprocess crashes and generates a core file when the process queries \nRDB Top SQL attribute groups.\n\n2.2 Defects\n-----------\n\n2.3 Enhancements: \n-----------------\n\nEnhancement: INTERNAL\nAbstract: User interface configuration improvements.\n\n- Simplifies the database connection configuration \nwith three connection types:\n- Basic: Oracle database server host name (or IP address),\nListener port, and Oracle database service\nname (or Oracle SID) must be specified.\n- TNS: only the TNS Alias must be specified or selected\nfrom the drop-down list that is discovered\nfrom the ORACLE_HOME\/network\/admin\/tnsnames.ora file.\n- Advanced: only the Oracle connection string must be \nspecified to be compatible with an old\nversion of agent configuration.\n\n- Supports the following connection string format: \n\"\/\/hostname:port\/ORACLE_SID\".\n\n- At least one database connection must be added during\nthe GUI configuration.\n\nEnhancement: INTERNAL\nAbstract: New environment variables that you can use to \ncustomize the agent, such as KRZ_LISTENER_INCLUDE, \nKRZ_LISTENER_EXCLUDE, KRZ_TNS_INCLUDE, KRZ_TNS_EXCLUDE,\nKRZ_REDIRECT_TNS, KRZ_EVENT_LEVEL, and KRZ_SQL_PREFILTER.\n\n- Provides the option to control whether the agent monitors\nthe specific Listener name and Oracle net service end points.\nBoth including and excluding filters are provided \n(KRZ_LISTENER_INCLUDE,KRZ_LISTENER_EXCLUDE, \nKRZ_TNS_INCLUDE, KRZ_TNS_EXCLUDE).\n\n- Provides the option (KRZ_REDIRECT_TNS) to control whether\nto redirect the value of the predefined TNS_ADMIN environment\nvariable to the agent log directory to disable the Oracle \nsqlnet.log.\n\n- Provides the option (KRZ_EVENT_LEVEL) to control which \nlevel of agent event is sent. The level with a scope from high\nto low is MISC, INFO, WARN, or ERROR.\n\n- Provides the option (KRZ_SQL_PREFILTER) to control whether the\nagent combines the filter information in the SQL query that is\nsent to the Oracle database for the data processing.\n\n\nEnhancement: INTERNAL\nAbstract: Performance improvement for Top SQL monitoring.\n\nEnhancement: INTERNAL\nAbstract: Disk Space usage monitoring for Archive Destination\nwhen Archive destination is defined in the Oracle database as\nUSE_DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST instead of a real physical directory.\n\nEnhancement: \nAbstract: More SQL statement samples in the krzcussql.properties\ncustomized SQL template file for Oracle Jobs, Oracle Users, \nand Oracle Queues monitoring.\n\nA total of six sample SQL statements are in the default \ncustomized SQL template file. To ensure the sample customized\nSQL can be run successfully, the SELECT authority from \ncorresponding Oracle performance views must be granted to the\nOracle user of the agent in advance.\n\nSQL_ID:

fixes\n---------------------------------------------------- \n6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAPAR : IV22637\nAbstract : AGENT CORE DUMP IF TNSPING IS NOT ACCESSABLE\nAdditional Information: A core dump occurs for the Oracle Database \nExtended agent if the agent is configured with KRZ_ORACLE_HOME but, \n$ORACLE_HOME\/bin\/tnsping file did not grant read+execute permission\nto the agent OS user.\n\nAPAR : IV14403\nAbstract : TABLESPACE PERCENT_FREE_TO_MAX CALCULATE WRONG\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent might calculate \nthe value of the Percent_Free_To_Max attribute incorrectly, because this value\nshould be greater than the value of the Percent_Free_To_Allocated attribute\nin case the Oracle tablespace is set with Autoextend ON and \nthe maximum file size of the data file is greater than the allocated size \nfor the current datafile.\n\n6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0002\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nAPAR: IV08618\nAbstract : AGENT OCCUPY ORACLE SESSION MORE AND MORE\nAdditional Information: The Oracle Database Extended agent occupies the\nOracle sessions increasingly if the Oracle Database Extended agent user\ndoes not have all authorities in the krzgrant.sql file.\nThis increase is caused by the agent not disconnecting from the Oracle\ndatabase, with an error message of \"ORA-00942 Table or View does not\nexist,\" and the agent trying to reconnect to the Oracle database with a new\nsession in each interval.\n\nDefect: 167731\nAbstract: agent configure still load based version xml file.\nAdditional Information: A new rz_dd_063100002.xml file is\ninstalled in the itmhome\\config directory by this patch, \nwhere the base version of the rz_dd_063100000.xml file is installed.\n\nThe agent loads the configuration definition from the newly installed\nrz_dd_063100002.xml file instead of the base version file.\n\nDefect: 168694\nAbstract: cannot ignore Oracle Listener\/Net Service definition.\nAdditional Information: A new KRZ_LOAD_ORACLE_NET environment variable \nis added so you can decide whether the Listener and Net Service End Points\nfrom the files below are required for monitoring.\n\nOn UNIX and Linux systems:\n$ORACLE_HOME\/network\/admin\/listener.ora\n$ORACLE_HOME\/network\/admin\/tnsnames.ora\n$TNS_ADMIN\/network\/admin\/listener.ora\n$TNS_ADMIN\/network\/admin\/tnsnames.ora\n\nOn Windows systems:\n%ORACLE_HOME%\\network\\admin\\listener.ora\n%ORACLE_HOME%\\network\\admin\\tnsnames.ora\n%TNS_ADMIN%\\network\\admin\\listener.ora\n%TNS_ADMIN%\\network\\admin\\tnsnames.ora \n\nIf this new variable is set to 'false', the agent\ndoes not load Listener or Net Service definitions from the files above,\neven if the agent is configured with ORACLE HOME directory.\n\nThe agent still loads Listener or Net Service definition if the agent\nis configured with a TNS PATH directory, which contains the\nlistener.ora or tnsnames.ora files.\n\nDefect: 168966\nAbstract: ASM disk\/diskgroup display redundancy data.\nAdditional Information: In an Oracle RAC environment, if there is more\nthan one active ASM database instance, the agent queries back multiple\nrows for each disk or disk group in all active instances.\nIf there is a situation in monitoring the attributes such as \nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP.Free_Percent, there are\nduplicated alerts by this type of situation.\n\nThe agent queries back only one record for each disk or disk group, and \navoids the duplicated alert for the situation.\n\nThe following attribute groups are impacted by this fix:\n\nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISKGROUP\nKRZ_RDB_ASM_DISK\nKRZ_ASM_DISK\nKRZ_ASM_DISKGROUP\n\nDefect: 168967\nAbstract: FreeToMax return negative value. \nAdditional Information: The agent gets a negative value or over 100% on the\nfollowing attributes because the Maximum file size of an Oracle\ndata file is less than the real data file size:\n\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACENORMAL_USAGE.Percentage_Free_To_Maximum\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACENORMAL_USAGE.Percentage_Allocated\nKRZ_RDB_TABLESPACETEMP_USAGE.Percentage_Allocated\n\nDefect: 172392\nAbstract: CANNOT MERGE CUSTOM SQL FOR BASETABLE \nAdditional Information: Use the KRZ_CUSTOM_SQLXML environment variable \nto specify a customized\nkrzsql_custom.xml file where the new SQLInfo is defined and the agent\nuses SQLInfo from the customized sql xml file instead of the \ndefault krzsql.xml file.

The \ntarget node for an updateAgent command is always an OS agent.\n\n- The following error might occur with the updateAgent command on \nLinux and UNIX endpoints; however, the agent is successfully \nupdated. This error does not occur on Windows endpoints.\n\nKUICUA011I: Updating the rz agents.\nKUICUA015E: The updateAgent command did not complete because an\nerror occurred. Refer to the following error\nreturned from the server:\n\nThe monitoring server encountered an error while updating the\nmanaged system type.\n\nThe kuiras1.log file might provide more information about \nthis error. If you require further assistance to resolve the \nerror, contact IBM Software Support.\n\nA timeout occurred while waiting for an agent task to complete on\n{node name}.\n\nThe agent task did not complete within the configured \ntime out period.\n\nVerify that the target system is online. Increase the \ntime out value and try the operation again.\n\n\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------\nFix 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_EXT-FP0001 included changes to the agent\nsupport files that must be installed. If you have already\ninstalled these updates, there are no additional installation\nsteps. Otherwise, use the following steps to update the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, or\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file \nto the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Servers, IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Portal Servers, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktops. \n\n2. Expand the archive file using the tar command on UNIX systems or an \nunzip utility on Windows systems. \n\n3. Use the procedures in the \"IBM Tivoli Monitoring, Version 6.2.2\nInstallation and Setup Guide.\"\n\n4. Use the procedures in the specific database monitoring agent user's\nguide to complete the installation and configuration.\n\n5. If the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server being updated is remote (not a \nHub Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server) then restart the Tivoli Enterprise \nMonitoring Server.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================================\n\n6.1 Verifying the update\n------------------------\n1. To verify that the agent was updated correctly, use the tacmd command to \nview the current version of the agent. You are required to log in \nto a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server before you view the agent\nversion. \n\nFor example:\nOn a UNIX system, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems -t rz\n\nOn a Windows system, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\ibm\\itm'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t RZ \n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is \n06.31.02.00\n\nNote:\nThe component (-t) for the tacmd listSystems command is specified \nas two characters (RZ), not three characters (KRZ).\n\n2. To verify that the agent support files were updated correctly, use \nthe kincinfo command on Windows systems or the cinfo command on Linux\nor UNIX systems to dump the component versions on each of the \nfollowing systems: Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal desktop. \n\nNote: \nThe kincinfo and cinfo command output examples in the sections\nthat follow show all components that can be updated. If you do\nnot have all of these components installed, components that \nare not installed are not displayed in the output of these commands. \n\n\nSample output for the cinfo command on a UNIX or Linux systems\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nTo validate that all components are installed, run the\nfollowing command:\n\n.\/cinfo\n\nThis command provides four options on the CINFO menu shown in\nthe example that follows.

These SQLs are executed only if there is a situation or \nyou click \"Link to SQL Result\" in the workspace \"Customized SQLs ->\nRDB Customized SQL Summary Definition\".\n\n- Problem: agent environment variable or error trace level do not take\neffective.\n- Workaround: If you must edit an environment variable such as setting a new\nerror trace level, the new variable must be modified in both the \ninstalldir\/config\/rz.ini file and the installdir\/config\/rz_<instance>.config\nfile, and you must restart agent.\n\n- Problem: agent report ORA-00942 error message in the log files like\nfollowing. Oracle Database Server is 10.1.0.2.\nERROR at line 1:\nORA-00942: table or view does not exist\nORA-06512: at line 128\n- Workaround: Run the krzgrant.sql script in 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-FP0001 to resolve\nthis error.\n\n- Problem: tacmd listsystems command does not display proper version\nfor offline agent's subnode.\nFor subnode e.g. RZ:HOSTNAME-INSTANCE-CONNECTION:RDB, version is\ndisplaying as 06.31.01.XX, Status is 'N'.\n- Workaround: Check the version from the root node of the agent to get the correct\nversion, for example, for INSTANCE:HOSTNAME:RZ, the version is displayed as \n06.31.01.00. \n\n- Problem: After upgrading to Fix Pack 2 and configuring the Oracle\nDatabase Extended agent silently, the agent cannot\nconnect to the database, which is specified by the\nKRZ_CONN_STR parameter in the silent configuration\nresponse file.\n- Workaround: The KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter specifies the connection\ntype. The Advanced type is required to configure a\ndatabase connection with the KRZ_CONN_STR\nconnection string. For example:\n\nKRZ_CONN_STR.connection=\/\/host:port\/service\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.connection=Advanced\n\nTo solve the problem, update the silent configuration\nresponse file to specify the KRZ_CONN_TYPE parameter and\nreconfigure the agent instance silently. For example:\n\n# cat \/tmp\/silent_config.txt\n############ PRIMARY TEMS CONFIGURATION ############\nCMSCONNECT=YES\nHOSTNAME=tivp055.cn.ibm.com\nNETWORKPROTOCOL=ip.pipe\nIPPIPEPORTNUMBER=1918\n############ Database connection config ############\nINSTANCE=inst1\nKRZ_CONN_USERID=tivoli\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD=password\nKRZ_INSTANT_CLIENT_LIBPATH=\/opt\/IBM\/oci\nKRZ_DYNAMIC_LISTENER=FALSE\n###\nKRZ_CONN_STR.asm=\/\/tivx010:1521\/+ASM\nKRZ_CONN_USERID.asm=sys\nKRZ_CONN_PASSWORD.asm=oracle\nKRZ_CONN_MODE.asm=SYSDBA\nKRZ_CONN_TYPE.asm=Advanced\n\n# \/opt\/IBM\/ITM\/bin\/itmcmd config -A -o inst1\n-p \/tmp\/silent_config.txt rz\n\n- Problem: The Oracle Database Extended agent reports the error\nmessage ORA-03135: connection lost contact and the\nsubnode that represents the monitored database\nconnection is still offline in the Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nafter the monitored database recovers to active status..\n- Workaround: The Oracle Database might disconnect all active connections\nand reject new connections under certain circumstances.\nAn example is when resources such as CPU are exhausted\nin the Oracle Server.\nTo solve the problem, ensure that the Oracle Database\nand Oracle Listener are open to the new connection and\nrestart the agent instance.\n\n- Problem: After you upgrade to V6.3.1 Fix Pack 2, the subnode ID\nis truncated from 25 characters to 24 characters. The\noriginal subnode with 25 characters changes to gray, and\nthe new subnode with 24 characters is displayed.\n- Workaround: This behavior is expected. In 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0001\nor later versions, the agent changed the maximum\nsubnode ID from 25 characters to 24 characters to avoid\nthe following problem, which is a known APAR for IBM\nTivoli Monitoring V6.2.2 Fix Pack 4: \"pure event cannot\nfire when subnode name length is equal to or greater\nthan 32 characters.\"\nTo avoid truncation of the subnode from 25 characters to\n24 characters, use one of the following two options:\n\nOption 1: Set the following variable to a value of 25 in\nthe agent environment variable files:\nKRZ_MAX_SUBNODE_ID_LENGTH=25. After you upgrade,\nthe default value is 24.\nNote:\n- On UNIX or Linux operating systems, the\nenvironment variable files include\ninstalldir\/config\/rz.ini and installdir\/config\/\nrz_instance.config.\n- On Windows operating systems, the environment\nvariable files include installdir\\TMAITM6\\\nKRZENV_instance (32-bit) or installdir\\\nTMAITM6_X64\\KRZENV_instance (64-bit).\n\nOption 2: Reduce the length of the database\nconnection name, agent instance name, or host name;\nor, see Changing default naming conventions for\ndatabase connections in the Installation and\nConfiguration Guide for the Oracle Database Extended\nagent for information.\n\n8.0 Additional product information\n==================================\nNone.\n\n\n9.0 Notices\n===========\nThis information was developed for products and services offered \nin the United States.

    "reference_doc": "IBM Purging the connection pool of a WebSphere Application Server data source using the data source MBean - United States\n\nwas app server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n During the testing or troubleshooting of an enterprise application, it may become necessary to purge the connection pool of a WebSphere Application Server data source of existing connections. \n\nSYMPTOM\nChanges to the application or environment may invalidate cached connections in the Connection Manager pool. Although these connections will eventually be discarded through the normal processing of the connection requests, it may be desirable to purge them all at once and allow the pool to refill with new, valid connections.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWebSphere Application Server has an operation on the data source MBean that can be used to purge the connection pool. WebSphere Application Server MBean may be called via the wsadmin console, see the IBM Information Center topic \"Scripting the application serving environment (wsadmin)\" for more details. The operation name is: purgePoolContents. \n\nThe purgePoolContents operation has two options: \n\n 1. Normal:  * This is the default option. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. \n     * Shared connection requests will be honored. \n     * Free connections are cleaned up and destroyed. \n     * In use connections (for example: connections in transactions) are cleaned up and destroyed when returned to the connection pool. \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents will be done synchronously (for example: wait for the jdbc driver to return before proceeding). \n     * Requests for new connections (not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 2. Immediate:  * No new transactions will be allowed to start on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * No new handles will be handed out on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. Any new activities on a purged Connection will cause a StaleConnectionException or an XAER_FAIL exception (in the case of XA) \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call will be done asynchronously (for example: no waiting for the jdbc driver to return) This is useful if the driver returns. \n     * Due to the fact that close() does not wait, the number of connections will be decremented immediately in WebSphere Application Server. This might cause the total number of connections in WebSphere Application Server to be temporarily out of sync with the database total number of connections. \n     * Requests for new connections (for example: not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n    \n    \n\n\nExamples of operations that can be executed on the data source MBean using the wasdmin console:  1. List all data sources:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,*\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,*\")\n    \n    \n 2. Initialize a variable to specify a data source (this example uses Default Datasource, but any data source name listed in the output of above command can be used):\n    Using Jacl:\n    set name \"Default Datasource\"\n    set ds [$AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,name=$name,*] \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    name = \"Default Datasource\"\n    ds = AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,name=\"+name+\",*\") \n    \n    \n 3. View the pool contents by invoking the showPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showPoolContents\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 4. View contents of all pools by invoking the showAllPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showAllPoolContents\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showAllPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 5. Immediately purge the pool by invoking the purgePoolContents operation of the data source MBean with the immediate option:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds purgePoolContents immediate\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"purgePoolContents\", \"immediate\")\n    \n    \n\nIf the purge operation is successful, no response will be observed. If the purge operation is not successful, the response will indicate a possible reason for failure. One common reason for failure is attempting to purge the contents of a connection pool which is not yet available (the connection pool is not created until a naming look-up of the associated datasource or connection factory occurs), resulting in an illegal state exception.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK Application Servers WebSphere Application Server for z\/OS Java SDK z\/OS 8.0, 7.0, 6.1",

When it detects a certain number of consecutively aborted batches on a single thread, Rulerunner shuts down all threads. By default, the threshold is three batches, so shutdown occurs if four batches abort consecutively.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nWith Rulerunner logging turned on, aborting batches will show in the rulerunnerX.log files (where X is the thread number. If there is a question as to whether a Rulerunner shutdown is being caused by this feature, check the rulerunnerX logs for each thread to see if there are four consecutive aborts followed by a shutdown.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIf there is a need to change this behavior due to situations where a large number of batches might legitimately abort, the threshold can be increased or the feature can be turned off through the following registry keys.\n\n\nx86 (32-bit) OS: \n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Datacap\\Rulerunner\\Misc (REG_DWORD) Restart\nIndividual processors [default: 1] \n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Datacap\\Rulerunner\\Misc (REG_DWORD) Restart\nprocessor Attempts [default: 3] \n\n \n\nx64 (64-bit) OS: \n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Datacap\\Rulerunner\\Misc\n(REG_DWORD) Restart Individual processors [default: 1) \n\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Wow6432Node\\Datacap\\Rulerunner\\Misc\n(REG_DWORD) Restart processor Attempts [default: 3] \n\n \n\n * Restart Individual processors - 1 is on, 0 is off. \n * Restart processor Attempts - Number of times Rulerunner will move to the next batch without shutting down the threads after a series of batches abort.\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Enterprise Content Management Datacap Taskmaster Capture Not Applicable Windows 8.1.0.3",

For MySQL versions prior to 5.7.9, selecting from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables produces an empty result set with a deprecation warning. \n\n \n\nNote: MySQL agent is packaged with ITCAM for Applications (IBM Tivoli Monitoring) and Application Performance Monitoring 8.1.x solutions.\n\n\nCAUSE\nFew tables in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA that are used by the agent to collect monitoring data are deprecated in the MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above. Due to this deprecation these tables cannot be queried normally and cause an error when the agent tries to query these tables to get data.\n\n\nMore details about the MySQL INFORMATION_SCHEMA migration to performance_schema here: \n\nhttps:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/5.7\/en\/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html [https:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/5.7\/en\/performance-schema-variable-table-migration.html]\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nMySQL agent installed on MySQL Server versions 5.7.6 and above.\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nUsers wanting to run the agent on MySQL server versions 5.7.6 and above should use the 'show_compatibility_56' [https:\/\/dev.mysql.com\/doc\/refman\/5.7\/en\/server-system-variables.html] system variable which affects whether MySQL 5.6 compatibility is enabled with respect to how system and status variable information is provided by the INFORMATION_SCHEMA. \n\nThis variable can be set from the MySQL command prompt as: \n\nset global show_compatibility_56=ON; \n\n \n\nThe default value of the variable 'show_compatibility_56' for MySQL server versions <=5.7.7 is ‘ON’ and for versions >=5.7.8 is ‘OFF’. \n\n \n\nUser can check the value of this variable by running the following command from the MySQL command prompt: \n\nshow global variables like \"show_compatibility_56\"; \n\n \n\nThis variable can also be set in the MySQL server configuration file also called as Option file. \n\nUser needs to add the following line to the ‘my.cnf’ file (located at ‘<MySQL_Installation_Dir>\/my.cnf’ for Windows and ‘\/etc\/my.cnf’ for UNIX\/Linux): \n\nshow_compatibility_56=ON \n\n \n\nThe paths mentioned above are the default paths for the Option file.

It deletes REQMETRICS and RESPMETRICS table rows where SRTTIME (start of period) is more than 24 hours ago. So these two tables, which are responsible for most of KD4SDMS storage occupation, should not grow unbounded anymore.\n\nNOTE: ITCAM for SOA 7.1.1 is Out-Of-Support since 2015 April 30.",

The extracted text is added to the Search index allowing users to find documents based on the content. \n\nWhen the Stellent utility is not configured correctly, file content will not be extracted or indexed. Therefore, search results within IBM Connections will not contain any matches on file content. For any content extraction issues, follow the steps in this tech note. \n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n 1 Stellent installation \n\nEnsure that the following IBM Connections post-installation task has been carried out:\nhttp:\/\/www-10.lotus.com\/ldd\/lcwiki.nsf\/dx\/Copying_Search_conversion_tools_to_local_nodes_ic40 [http:\/\/www-10.lotus.com\/ldd\/lcwiki.nsf\/dx\/Copying_Search_conversion_tools_to_local_nodes_ic40]\n\n\n 2 Running the exporter in isolation from IBM Connections \n\nTo verify that the exporter is working correctly, you can run it on the command line in isolation from IBM Connections. To run the exporter executable on the command line, execute the following as the user that the Search WebSphere Application Server is running under: \n\n1. Change directory to the Stellent binary location. For example: \n\n $ cd \/opt\/IBM\/Connections\/data\/local\/search\/stellent\/dcs\/oiexport\n\n2. Run the exporter command.\nThe exporter command has the following syntax: \n\n exporter inputpath=<path_to_input_file>\noutputpath=<path_to_extracted_text_output>\noutputid=FI_SEARCHTEXT\n\nFor example,\n$ .\/exporter inputpath=\/root\/translation.pdf \\ outputpath=\/root\/testStellent.txt outputid=FI_SEARCHTEXT\n\nIf the text extraction worked successfully, you will see the following output: \n\nExport complete\n\nHowever, if you see a message like the one below, continue to step 3:\n\n.\/exporter: error while loading shared libraries: libsc_ex.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory \n\n\n 3 Operating System Environment Variables \n\nEnsure that the operating system environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH are set correctly in Section 1. Both variables should contain the Stellent installation directory. To get the current values of the environment variables, run the following commands as the user that the Search WebSphere Application Server is running under:\n\n$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n$ echo $PATH\n\nTo verify that the Stellent exporter executable can be found through the PATH environment variable, run the following command:\n\n$ which exporter\n\nThe output of this command should contain the full path to the exporter executable. For example:\n\n\/opt\/IBM\/Connections\/data\/local\/search\/stellent\/dcs\/oiexport\/exporter\n\n\n 4 WebSphere Environment \n\nUsing the WebSphere Application Server administration console, ensure that the WebSphere environment variable FILE_CONTENT_CONVERSION points to the exporter executable. \n\nFor example: \/opt\/IBM\/Connections\/data\/local\/search\/stellent\/dcs\/oiexport\/exporter\n\n\n 5 File Permissions \n\nEnsure that the user that the Search WebSphere Application Server is running under has sufficient privileges. They should have read\/write\/execute permissions on the exporter executable and read\/write permissions on the other files in the Stellent installation directory.\n\n\n 6 Library compatibility \n\nVerify that the libraries deployed with Stellent are compatible with your platform.\n\nFor example, on a 64 bit Linux system:\n$ uname -a\nLinux host1 2.6.18-308.11.1.el5 #1 SMP Fri Jun 15 15:41:53 EDT 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU\/Linux\n\n$ cd \/opt\/IBM\/Connections\/data\/local\/search\/stellent\/dcs\/oiexport\n$ file libsc_ex.so\nlibsc_ex.so: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, AMD x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped\n\n(Note that your Stellent installation may contain 32 bit libraries though you are running on 64 bit platform. This is not an issue, provided that the 32 bit compatible libraries are on the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or can be found on the shared library search path).\n\n\n 7 Shared library dependencies \n\nThe Stellent exporter executable has a number of dependencies on both the shared libraries packaged with Stellent and on shared libraries installed on your system. To verify that all the required shared libraries can be found, use the 'ldd' command on the exporter executable as follows:\n\n$ ldd -v exporter\n\nCheck the output of this command for any shared libraries marked as '=> not found'. \n\n Stellent shared library not found \n\nIf a Stellent shared library can't be found, then check that the setting of your LD_LIBRARY_PATH operating system environment variable contains the Stellent installation directory. \n\n System shared library not found \n\nIf a system shared library can't be found, then you are missing a prerequisite library.\nNOTE: It is still possible to pick up libraries from locations other than those included in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH operating system environment variable, as long as they can be found elsewhere on the system's default search path. \n\nIn addition to libc.so.6, Stellent is dependent upon the following libraries: \nlibstdc++.so.5\nlibgcc_s.so.1 \n\nFor Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.0 and later, it is possible that you are missing the package compat-libstdc++-33 . This package contains libstdc++.so.5.\n\n\n\n\n * \n *",

Installing APAR fixes (PTFs) using Recommended Service Upgrades (RSUs) as early as possible can help avoid problems that could result in a service call, and as long as you test appropriately, help reduce risks to your business. \n\nCONTENT\n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27048530&amp;aid=1]Embedded components in CICS TS [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27012749#delivering]\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27048530&amp;aid=2]Update recommendations\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27048530&amp;aid=3]Related information \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents in CICS TS\n\nCICS TS provides the following embedded runtime components: \n\n * Equinox\n   Equinox is an implementation of the OSGi core framework specification and is provided for both OSGi JVM servers and for Liberty JVM servers. Service for these components is provided when and if required.\n   \n   \n * Apache Axis2™ \n   Axis2 is an open source web services engine from the Apache Software Foundation and is used within CICS to provide the web service Java™ engine for the Axis2 JVM server environment. Service for this component is provided when and if required.\n   \n   \n * WebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile\n   Liberty fix packs are provided on a regular basis through the CICS TS APAR delivery process and provide an update mechanism to keep the embedded CICS Liberty runtime synchronized with the fix packs provided by WebSphere Application Server. Keeping current helps you resolve problems faster for 2 reasons:  * Liberty APAR fixes (known as ifixes) can only be delivered on the latest Liberty fix pack that has been supplied by the CICS APAR process. \n    * CICS APAR fixes can require other fixes such as WebSphere Liberty fix packs.\n   \n   \n   \n\nCICS Explorer and z\/OS Explorer\nThe CICS Software Development Kit (SDK) for Java includes components from CICS for developing CICS Java applications. The CICS SDK for Servlet and JSP support includes Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Liberty API libraries, and automatically installs required components such as WebSphere Developer Toolkit (WDT).\" Service for these components is provided through the CICS Explorer fix pack process when and if required. \n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27048530&amp;aid=4] Back to Top \n\n\nUpdate recommendations\n\nRecommended Service Upgrade (RSU) \nIBM recommends that you install all RSU [http:\/\/www-03.ibm.com\/systems\/z\/os\/zos\/support\/servicetest\/] PTFs as preventive software maintenance for CICS TS. An RSU is a predefined collection of PTFs identified with a SOURCEID of RSUyymm, where yy indicates the last 2 digits of the year and mm indicates the month. [http:\/\/www-03.ibm.com\/servers\/eserver\/zseries\/zos\/servicetst\/]You can order an RSU [http:\/\/www-1.ibm.com\/servers\/eserver\/zseries\/zos\/servicetst\/]from ShopzSeries [https:\/\/www14.software.ibm.com\/webapp\/ShopzSeries\/ShopzSeries.jsp].\n\n\nEquinox and Apache Axis2\nThere is unlikely to be much maintenance for Equinox and Axis2. Service for these components is provided when and if required, meaning it will be on a case by case basis and in most cases this will be to resolve service requests.\n\n\nWebSphere Application Server Liberty Profile\nRefer to Updating Liberty profile for CICS TS and z\/OS Connect EE to latest version [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21993579] for a list of APARs you will need to update CICS TS and z\/OS Connect Enterprise Edition (EE) to the latest version of WebSphere Application Server Liberty profile. \n\n\nCICS Explorer\nIBM recommends that you upgrade to the latest release of CICS Explorer to obtain the most recent functionality and service. Old releases of CICS Explorer are not generally updated with new function, but new CICS Explorer releases are compatible with all earlier versions of CICS TS. Therefore, CICS Explorer V5.4 is compatible with CICS TS V4.1 through V5.4.

In this case, a second DE was installed, which caused the failure of the Product upgrade.\nError: Wrong Deployment Engine. \n\nSYMPTOM\nProduct install failed. You will get a message similar to this:\nYou are updating an instance of <Product name> that was installed using \nthe Tivoli Deployment Engine (DE) located at \"\/home\/nc_admin\/.acsi_<Fully Qualified hostname>\". \nHowever you are now using the DE located at \"\/home\/nc_admin\/.acsi_<hostname>\". \n\n\nWhen the DE is installed as non-root ( in this case nc_admin ), it will install the DE in the user home directory, in this case \/home\/nc_admin, and use the FQDN in the name: \/home\/nc_admin\/.acsi_<Fully Qualified hostname> \n\n\nCAUSE\nBecause the two Product installs used different versions of JVM, the underlying Java is using \"hostname\" for one version of JVM, and \"Fully Qualified hostname\" for the other. The DE normally uses the FQDN appended to the \"acsi_\" string to create the DE directory:\n\nFor example, if the Product is being installed as user \"nc_admin\" and the entry in \/etc\/hosts is this:\n\nx.xx.xxx.xx server_name.corporation.net server_name\n\nThe hostname is \"server_name\"\nFully Qualified hostname (FQDN) is \"server_name.corporation.net\"\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nUpgrading existing product that uses the Deployment Engine on a UNIX server\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nOutput similar to this when the Product install fails: \n\nthe Tivoli Deployment Engine (DE) located at \"\/home\/nc_admin\/.acsi_<Fully qualified hostname>\". \nHowever you are now using the DE located at \"<User_home>\/nc_admin\/.acsi_<hostname>\"\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThere are two options to fix this problem. \n\n1) Make sure the current upgrade is using the same version of JVM as the original install. \n\n2) Removing the newly created DE, which shouldn't have been created, then creating a link to the existing DE is the best work around in this case. The Product upgrade will see the link and add the information to the valid DE install. \n\n*IMPORTANT NOTE: The Product install failure message will tell you what instance of the DE is valid, please refer to the error message in the \"Symptom\" section above. \n\n At this point there will be the following in the DE_HOME directory: \n\n .acsi_<FQDN> ( Valid DE installation ) \n\n .acsi_<userid> ( link to .acsi_<FQDN> ) \n\n .acsi_<hostname> ( Invalid DE directory created by the failed Product upgrade ) \n\n This can be confirmed by referring to the Product install error. \n\n Removing the invalid DE and creating softlink: \n\n - Backup the original DE installation directory: <DE_HOME>\/.acsi_<FQDN> \n\n - Move the new invalid DE directory to a backup directory: <DE_HOME>\/.acsi_<hostname> \n\n - Create a soft link to the \"good\" DE install \n\n cd <DE_HOME> \n\n ln -s <DE_HOME>\/.acsi_<FQDN> .acsi_<hostname> \n\n - Confirm the link was created successfully, it should look like this: \n> ls -lart \nlrwxrwxrwx 1 nc_admin ncoadmin <date> .acsi_<hostname> -> <DE_HOME>\/.acsi_<FQDN> \n\n \n3) Retry the product install.

SSLv3 is enabled by default in the Apache based IBM HTTP Server. \n\nVULNERABILITY DETAILS\nCVE ID: CVE-2014-3566 [http:\/\/cve.mitre.org\/cgi-bin\/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566]\nDESCRIPTION: IBM HTTP Server could allow a remote attacker to obtain sensitive information, caused by a design error when using the SSLv3 protocol. A remote user with the ability to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability via a POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) attack to decrypt SSL sessions and access the plain text of encrypted connections. \n\nCVSS Base Score: 4.3\nCVSS Temporal Score: See https:\/\/exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com\/vulnerabilities\/97013 [https:\/\/exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com\/vulnerabilities\/97013] for the current score\nCVSS Environmental Score*: Undefined\nCVSS Vector: (AV:N\/AC:M\/Au:N\/C:P\/I:N\/A:N) \n\nAFFECTED PRODUCTS AND VERSIONS\nThis vulnerability affects all versions and releases of IBM HTTP Server (IHS) component in all editions of WebSphere Application Server and bundling products.\n\n\nREMEDIATION\/FIXES\nThere is no separate interim fix for the PI27904 APAR that is associated with this issue, but the interim fix for APAR PI31516 (TLS Padding Vulnerability CVE-2014-8730 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21692502]) includes the update for APAR PI27904. APAR PI27904 update disables SSLv3 by default for IHS 7.0 and newer, and adds the 'SSLProtocolEnable' directive into IHS 7.0. \n\nThe update for PI27904 will be included in fix packs 7.0.0.37, 8.0.0.10 and 8.5.5.4. \n\n\nWORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS\nFor all releases and versions of Apache based IBM HTTP Server, IBM recommends disabling SSLv3: \n\n\nAdd the following directive to the httpd.conf file to disable SSLv3 and SSLv2 for each context that contains \"SSLEnable\":\n\n# Disable SSLv3 for CVE-2014-3566\n# SSLv2 is disabled in V8R0 and later by default, and in typical V7\n# and earlier configurations disabled implicitly when SSLv3 ciphers \n# are configured with SSLCipherSpec.\nSSLProtocolDisable SSLv3 SSLv2\n\nStop and restart IHS for the changes to take affect.\n\nNote: \n\n * If you start IHS with the -f command line argument, or you use the \"Include\" directive to include alternate configuration files, you may need to search those filenames for SSLEnable.\n\n * If you configure SSL with SSLEnable in the global (non-virtualhost) scope, you will need to move SSLEnable into a virtualhost scope to add SSLProtocolDisable\n\n\nIBM recommends that you review your entire environment to identify other areas that enable SSLv3 protocol and take appropriate mitigation (such as disabling SSLv3) and remediation actions.

There is most likely an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) between the BigFix server and our content sites at sync.bigfix.com that is dropping the download because it is detecting something in the download (one of the sites files) as being malicious. If you do not have an IPS between the BigFix server and the sync.bigfix.com servers; it may be the firewall or proxy appliance that is causing the issue. \n 2. Another cause might be that Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration is enabled for Administrators on the BigFix Windows server machine.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n \n\n 1. Check with the firewall\/proxy\/IPS\/network admin and ask them to check the logs for dropped packets or downloads and to adjust the rules to allow the BES Support site content through. \n 2. Try turning off Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration [https:\/\/blogs.technet.microsoft.com\/chenley\/2011\/03\/10\/how-to-turn-off-internet-explorer-enhanced-security-configuration\/] for Administrators to see if this resolves the issue.",

This behavior ensures that the installer does not overwrite product files that are currently running. The best practice is to shut down all components, including monitoring servers, portal server, and portal clients before you perform any product upgrade. This limitation only affects silent installations. Installations through the installation wizard is not affected.\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nAny Windows version \n\nAny ITM component installed silently\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nLook in <ITMHOME>\\InstallITM for a file name with syntax similar to: \nAbortIBMTivoliMonitoring<DATE TIME>.log\n\nFor example:\nAbortIBMTivoliMonitoring20150409 1014.log\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWorkaround: Use the following method to resolve the problem:\n1. Search the installation log for instances of the CheckLockedFiles string. Locked files are listed at these places. Locked files are files that might need to be upgraded during an installation, and because they are in use (locked) the silent install terminates.\n\n\n2. Identify the process that is locking the files.\n\n\n3. Stop the process.\n\n\n4. Prevent file locking by modifying the response file for installation file. This step is required when a silent installation has terminated. \n\na. Open the response file in a text editor. In many cases, the file in which you make this modification is named silent.txt. On Windows, the file to modify is the NT_Silent_Install.txt file that is located on the monitoring server.\nb. Add the following line to the [INSTALLATION SECTION] area of your silent install response file:\nLocked Files=continue\nIf you apply any other value or assign no value for this parameter, silent installations fail when locked files exist.\nc. If Locked Files=continue is used in a silent install or remote deploy, the computer MUST be rebooted before ITM is brought up or another install is run. This is mandatory or the <ITMHOME> directory could become corrupt. If the <ITMHOME> directory becomes corrupt, all of ITM will have to be uninstalled and reinstalled.\n\n\n5. Run the silent installation again.",

Where does the problem occur? Between what components?\n     \n     \n 2.  What is your topology?\n     \n     \n 3.  What are the symptoms noticed?\n     \n     \n 4.  How do you recover from this problem?\n     \n     \n 5.  What are the hostnames of the Client and the Application Servers?\n     \n     \n 6.  How often does this problem occur?\n     \n     \n 7.  Is there a firewall installed between the failing components?\n     \n     \n 8.  Can you successfully ping the server from the remote client? Can you ping the client from the remote server?\n     \n     \n 9.  Has this problem always occurred or has it just started to occur? If it just started, what changes were made?\n     \n     \n 10. Clear out the logs in the install_root\/logs directory, then recreate the problem.\n     \n     \n 11. Collect the following files:  * The newly created logs.\n        \n        \n      * Answers to the preceding questions.\n        \n        \n      * For releases of WebSphere Application Server versions 5.0 and 6.0  * collector.[sh\/bat] output\n           \n           \n        \n        \n      * Any additional information you think might relate (topology, symptoms, and so on) to IBM.\n        \n        Note: Additional ORB, Security, or WLM traces might be required.\n     \n     \n\n \n\nAdditional MustGather information for ORB interoperability problems \n\n 1.  What third-party ORB are you trying to use?\n     \n     \n 2.  What version is the third-party ORB using?\n     \n     \n 3.  What language is the third-party ORB using? (C++ or Java)\n     \n     \n 4.  What platform is the third-party ORB running on?\n     \n     \n 5.  What platform is WebSphere Application Server running on?\n     \n     \n 6.  Does the problem or error occur consistently or randomly?\n     \n     \n 7.  Is the problem reproducible? If so, what are the steps?\n     \n     \n 8.  Is WebSphere Application Server being used as the server or client to the third-party ORB?\n     \n     \n 9.  Has this worked before, or is this a new configuration?\n     \n     \n 10. Have you tried using the approach recommended in the CORBA Interop samples?\n     \n     \n 11. Where was the Interface Definition Language (IDL) compiled (what tool was used)?\n     \n     Note: See the WebSphere Application Server detailed system requirements [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27006921] for the information related to the third party ORB Supported\/Tested, then select WebSphere Version > Server Type > Search on third-party ORB in Software Requirements List.\n\n \n\nA collector output is required for the WebSphere Application Server support team to troubleshoot an ORB issue. By providing the collector output, your configuration can be reviewed to help get a better understanding of your topology and settings. \n\n\n * Detailed instructions on how to run the collector program can be found at the following link:\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEQTP_8.5.5\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/ae\/ttrb_runct.html [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEQTP_8.5.5\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc\/ae\/ttrb_runct.html] \n\nMake sure you do not run the collector program from within the WebSphere Application Server product installation root directory. This will lead to an error. Make a working directory where you can start the collector program. \n\nOnce you have run the collector program from the dmgr, upload the collector.jar file that is created.  \n\nIf specific ORB traces have been requested by the Application Server support team, use the following instructions:\n\nNOTE: In most cases, support is going to need a matching client and server side trace to troubleshoot the issue. In some cases, they may even need traces from the nodeagent.\n\n\n\n * WebSphere Application Server V6.1, V7.0, V8.0, and V8.5 ORB trace instructions \n   You can review the following video that walks you through setting up the ORB trace in the Administrative Console. It goes through each step listed below to make sure the ORB trace is enabled correctly. \n   \n   \n    1.  From the Administrative Console, select Servers > Application Servers > server_name > Change Log Details Levels.\n        \n        \n    2.  Remove any previous entries in the text field type the following:\n        \n        *=info:ORBRas=all\n        \n        \n    3.  Apply and save changes.\n        \n        \n    4.  Select Servers > Application Servers > server_name > Diagnostic Trace Service.\n        \n        \n    5.  Change the Maximum Number of Historical Files to 10 and maximum file size to 50mb\n        \n        \n    6.  Apply and save changes.\n        \n        \n    7.  Enabling Comm Trace:\n        \n        Application Server\n        From the Administrative Console, Select Servers > Application Servers > server_name > Container Services > ORB Service. Select the Orb Tracing check box to enable Comm Tracing.\n        \n        Node Agent\n        From the Administrative Console, select System Administration >Node Agent > nodeagent > ORB Service. Select the Orb Tracing check box to enable Comm Tracing.\n        \n        Deployment Manager\n        From the Administrative Console, Select System Administration > Deployment Manager > ORB Service. Select the Orb Tracing check box to enable Comm Tracing.\n        \n        NOTE: You will need to do a server restart for the Comm Tracing to be captured in the trace.log file. You can also leave the Orb Tracing check box checked permanently in case you run into another ORB issue in the future. That way, you don't have to do another server restart for the trace to be captured. Leaving the Orb Tracing check box checked won't log any data to a trace log unless you have the ORBRas=all trace string enabled (Step 2 above). This means it won't cause any performance issues or affect anything else in the server. \n    8.  Apply and save changes.\n        \n        \n    9.  Restart the sever and recreate the problem\n        \n        \n    10. Collect the following data:\n        \n        profile_root\/logs\/server_name\/trace.log\n   \n    * \n    * profile_root\n    * \/logs\/ffdc folder\n   \n    * \n      \n    * NOTE: \n    * \n    * date\n    * \n    * time\n    * \n    * \n   \n   \n * Stand Alone Java Client ORB Trace Instructions  1. Start the client program with the \"-D\" arguments to specify the trace settings\n       \n       -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.Debug=true -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.CommTrace=true -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.Debug.Output=client.log\n       \n       \n    2. The ORB trace output is captured in the path pointed by com.ibm.CORBA.Debug.Output.\n       \n       If the com.ibm.CORBA.Debug.Output parameter is not specified, the ORB trace output is captured in a unique trace file named orbtrc.<timestamp>.txt in the current directory of execution.\n       \n       \n    3. Collect the following file:\n       \n       orbtrc.<timestamp>.txt \n       \n       \n       \n   \n   \n * J2EE Client Trace Instructions  1. Start the launchClient script with the following arguments to enable the trace:\n       \n       install_root\/bin\/launchClient.sh <ear_file> -JVMOptions=\"-Dcom.ibm.CORBA.Debug=true -Dcom.ibm.CORBA.CommTrace=true\" -CCtrace=ORBRas=all -CCtracefile=orbtrace.txt -CCtraceMode=basic\n       \n       \n       Note: For Windows installations, use launchClient.bat instead of launchClient.sh\n       \n    2. The ORB trace output is captured in a unique trace file named orbtrace.txt in the current directory of execution.\n       \n       \n    3.

It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. \n\nSince Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. \n\nCAUSE\nApplication needs HTTP session time-out set.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: \n\n * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels \n * At the time when the application is packaged \n * In the application code\n\n\nSetting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console \n1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. \n\n\n2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. \n\n\n3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n          <session-config> \n      *          <session-timeout>60<\/session-timeout>\n * \n *       <\/session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. \n\nHTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary \n\nThe list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. \n\n1.

In the above example, this is the unicode character 0x0, but there are a number of other unicode characters that can cause the same result. The problem does not occur in the WebSphere Adapter itself because the WebSphere Adapters are entirely capable of handling full unicode data. Rather, the problem happens in some brokers which fail to properly serialize the incoming data into a valid XML object.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe only complete solution at this time is to not process unicode characters that are not valid in XML. This can be done by not importing data fields that might contain such characters or by purging such characters from the incoming data source. It is not sufficient to do filtering in the BO maps since the broker can still run into problems prior to this Java™ mapping. \n\n\nIf handling of fields containing these unicode characters is essential to your use case, it will be necessary to open a PMR with your broker's support team (rather than the WebSphere Adapter team) to determine if there are any alternatives available.\n\n \n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 75349\n344\n000",

Use\nthe following steps to install this fix.\n\n5.1 Before installing the fix \n------------------------------\n- The prerequisites listed under section 3.1 entitled 'Prerequisites\nfor this fix' must be installed before this fix can be installed.\n\n- For the purpose of this README, the symbol <CANDLEHOME> is the \nIBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory. The default value\nfor CANDLEHOME is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM' on UNIX systems and 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'\non Windows systems.\n\nBefore installing this fix on UNIX systems, set the environment \nvariable CANDLEHOME to the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation \ndirectory.\n\nFor example: \n> CANDLEHOME=\/opt\/IBM\/ITM \n> export CANDLEHOME\n\n- Because there is no uninstall utility for this fix, make sure to\nperform a backup of your environment before installing this fix.\n\n5.2 Local agent update\n--------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004.tar or .zip) to a temporary\ndirectory on the system that contains the agent code to be\nupdated. For the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP>\nrepresents the fully qualified path to this directory. Note: On\nWindows systems, this path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or \nan extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Use the \"itmpatch\" command to install the fix for the operating\nsystem for that agent. For more information on the \"itmpatch\"\ncommand, see section 6.2. \n\nOn UNIX systems, if the fix was expanded to \n<TEMP>\/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004, the install command is:\n\n> itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> \n-i <TEMP>\/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004\/kph_aix526_tema_if0004.tar\n\n5.3 Remote agent update\n----------------------------\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004.tar or .zip) to a temporary\ndirectory on the IBM Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server system.\nFor the purpose of this README, the symbol <TEMP> represents the\nfully qualified path to this directory. Note: On Windows systems,\nthis path includes the drive letter.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or \nan extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. To add the agent fix bundles into the remote deploy depot, use the\n\"tacmd addBundles\" command found in $CANDLEHOME\/bin on UNIX systems\nor in %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin on Windows systems. For more information\non the \"tacmd addBundles\" command, see the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\nAdministrator's Guide.\n\nOn UNIX systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004:\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\/6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004\n\nOn Windows systems, \nif the fix was expanded to <TEMP>\\6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd addBundles -n -i <TEMP>\\6.2.2.3-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004\n\nwhere:\n-n indicates that prerequisite bundles are not automatically\nadded. The -n parameter must be used because the fix \ndirectory does not contain any prerequisites that the fix\nmight require. Please see Section 3.1 for the prerequisites\nfor this fix.\n-i is the directory that contains the deployment bundles to be\nadded to the depot. \n\n4. To log in to the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring server, and deploy\nthe fix to the appropriate nodes where the agent is running, use\nthe following \"tacmd\" commands. For more information on the\n\"tacmd login\" and \"tacmd updateAgent\" commands, see the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Administrator's Guide.\n\nOn UNIX systems: \n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd updateAgent -t ph\n-n <Managed system name>\n-v 062203004\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems\n\nThe output shows the Managed System Name for the OS agent on the\nremote system to be updated. Use this value as the target of the\n\"tacmd updateAgent\" command.\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd updateAgent -t PH \n-n <Managed system name> \n-v 062203004\n\nNote:\n- The component (-t) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is\nspecified as two characters (PH), not three characters (KPH).\n- The node (-n) for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is the managed\nsystem name of the operating system (OS) agent to be updated.\nThe target node for the \"tacmd updateAgent\" command is always\nan OS agent.\n\n5.4 Agent support update\n------------------------------\n\nThis fix 6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004 includes changes to the agent\nsupport files which need to be installed. Use the following steps to\nupdate the Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server, Tivoli Enterprise\nPortal Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop.\n\n1. Transfer the appropriate archive file\n(6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004.tar or .zip) to the Tivoli\nEnterprise Monitoring Servers, Tivoli Enterprise Portal Servers,\nor Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktops.\n\n2. Expand the archive file using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems\nor an extract utility on Windows systems. This step creates a\ndirectory structure that contains fixes for all of the supported\nplatforms.\n\n3. Expand the archive file (kph_tems_teps_tepd_if0004.tar or .zip)\nthat contains the updates for Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server,\nTivoli Enterprise Portal Server, and Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nDesktop using the \"tar\" command on UNIX systems or an extract\nutility on Windows systems. This step creates a directory\nstructure that includes a subdirectory called CD-ROM, with the\nnecessary updates.\n\n4. Use the Application Support Installer(ASI) GUI or the silent\ninstallation method to install the application support files.\n\nNote: For IBM Tivoli Monitoring Version 6.3 or above, one\nof the following additional steps must be performed.\n\n1. Acquire a platform-specific pre-packaged JRE version\nof the Application Support Installer (ASI). See IBM\nTivoli Monitoring Application Support Installer,\n6.2-tiv-itm_asi-if0003 at\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24034924]\n\nfor download and installation instructions.\n\n-- OR --\n\n2. Specify the '-j javahome' parameter with the path to\na Java(r) 1.5 or java 1.6 installation when running\nthe itmasi.sh or itmasi.bat script described below.\n\nGUI installation option\n------------------------\nThe GUI can be started by using one of the following commands\nfrom within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is located.\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> .\/itmasi.sh [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>]\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi [-h <CANDLEHOME>] [-j <JAVAHOME>]\n\nWhen prompted by the Application Support Installer for the\ninstallable media directory, select the CD-ROM directory, not the\ncomponent directory. The installer can install updates for\nmultiple components at the same time.\n\nSilent installation option\n--------------------------\nTo use the silent installation option, use one of the following\ncommands from within the CD-ROM directory where setup.jar is\nlocated.\n\nNote: Using the silent installation option for Linux and zLinux\noperating systems requires the following files contained in\ninterim fix 6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0001:\n- Linux: setupLinux.bin\n- zLinux: setupLinux390.bin\nFollow the installation instructions contained in the\n\"6.2-TIV-ITM_ASI-IF0001.README\".\n\nOn UNIX systems:\n> .\/itmasi.sh -h <CANDLEHOME>[-silent]\n[-r <response file>]\n[-j <JAVAHOME>]\n\nOn Windows systems:\n> itmasi -h <CANDLEHOME> [-silent]\n[-r <response file>]\n[-j <JAVAHOME>]\n\nwhere:\n-h <CANDLEHOME> - Required. The path to the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory.\n\n-r <response file> - Optional. Customized response file name.\nThe default response file \"response.txt\" in\nthe CD-ROM directory can be copied and modified\nfor your environment. Do not update \"response.txt\".\n\n-j <JAVAHOME> - Optional. The fully-qualified path to the \"bin\"\ndirectory where Java(R) is installed. The\nlocation of Java on your system might vary.\n\n5. The next panel presented by the Application Support Installer asks\nfor the selection of which Tivoli Monitoring components you want\nto add application support to. For this fix, check or clear the\ncheck boxes as follows:\n\nchecked - Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring Server (TEMS)\nchecked - Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server (TEPS)\nchecked - Tivoli Enterprise Desktop Client (TEPD)\n\nContinue through the remaining GUI panels selecting the HMC Base\n06.22.03.04 support to complete the installation.\n\n6. If the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop or Tivoli Enterprise Portal\nBrowser was running when the update was installed, it must be\nrestarted.\n\n\n6.0 Additional installation information\n========================\n\nFor additional troubleshooting installation information, see the\nitmpatch.log in the patchlogs directory in <CANDLEHOME>.\n\n6.1 Installation instructions for agent baroc file\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThis fix 6.2.2.2-TIV-ITM_HMC_BASE-IF0004 includes changes to the\nagent baroc files that must be installed. Refer to IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring Installation and Setup Guide under \"Installing monitoring\nagent baroc files on the event server\" in \"Installing the IBM Tivoli\nEnterprise Console Event Synchronization\" section for more\ninformation.\n\n6.2 Additional information on using \"itmpatch\" command\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nThe \"itmpatch\" command has the following syntax:\n\nUsage: itmpatch -h <installation home> [OPTIONS]\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-t { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nitmpatch -h <installation home>\n-i { <patch_file_directory> | <patch_file> }\n\nwhere:\n-h Specifies the IBM Tivoli Monitoring installation directory\n-i Specifies the path to the directory or patch file to be installed\n-t Generates a report of the actions to be taken by the patch\n\n\nFor example, on UNIX systems:\n- To preview the fix installation, use the \"-t\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>\/bin\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -t <TEMP>\n\n- To install the fix, use the \"-i\" option:\n> <CANDLEHOME>\/bin\/itmpatch -h <CANDLEHOME> -i <TEMP>\n\nwhere:\n<CANDLEHOME> is the fully qualified IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory. On Windows systems, this path must include\nthe drive letter.\n<TEMP> represents the fully qualified directory specification where\nthe fix is located. On Windows systems, this must include the drive\nletter.\n\n6.3 Verifying the update\n----------------------------\n\n1. To verify the agent was updated correctly, use the \"tacmd\" command\nto view the agent's current version after the agent is restarted.\nYou are required to log in to a Tivoli Enterprise Monitoring\nServer prior to viewing the agent version.\n\nFor example:\nOn UNIX systems, where $CANDLEHOME is the IBM Tivoli Monitoring\ninstallation directory, the default location is '\/opt\/IBM\/ITM'. \n\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n> $CANDLEHOME\/bin\/tacmd listSystems -t PH\n\nOn Windows systems, where %CANDLE_HOME% is the IBM Tivoli\nMonitoring installation directory, the default location\nis 'C:\\IBM\\ITM'. \n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd login -s <server>\n-u <itmuser> \n-p <password>\n\n> %CANDLE_HOME%\\bin\\tacmd listSystems -t PH \n\nNote: The component (-t) for the \"tacmd listSystems\" command is\nspecified as two characters (PH), not three characters (KPH).\n\nWhen the agent update is successful, the agent version is:\n06.22.03.04.\n\n2. To verify the agent support files were updated correctly, use the\n\"kincinfo\" command on Windows systems or the \"cinfo\" command on\nLinux or UNIX systems. The sample output below shows the versions\nof the Tivoli Enterprise Portal Server, Tivoli Enterprise\nMonitoring Server, or Tivoli Enterprise Portal Desktop systems\nafter this fix has been successfully applied.\n\nNote: The displayed date of the build might not be accurate.

Installation Manager is installed in user mode through root user\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe upgrade must be initiated by using the attached script, which gives the non-root user (who originally installed this Jazz for Service Management instance) the correct permissions for the upgrade process. \n\n\nThe script takes two mandatory arguments and one optional argument.\n\nUsage: .\/JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh \"IM_Install_Location\" \n\"JazzSM_Install_Location [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0\/com.ibm.psc.doc\/ref\/psc_r_pathnames.html]\"\"[Response_file_with_absolute_Path]\"\n\nFor example (showing default installation paths): .\/JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh \"\/home\/root\/IBM\/InstallManager\/\" \"\/opt\/IBM\/JazzSM\/\" \"\/opt\/Download\/dash_upgrade_rsp.xml\"\n\n\nFor IM GUI mode installation, provide the 2 mandatory arguments; IM_Install_Location and JazzSM_Install_Location. \nThis argument combination invokes Installation Manager in GUI mode and lead you through the rest of the upgrade process.\n\nFor IM Silent installation, provide all 3 arguments; IM_Install_Location , JazzSM_Install_Location, and Response_file_with_absolute_Path.\nThis argument combination invokes Installation Manager in silent mode to upgrade JazzSM.\n\nJazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21985946&aid=2]JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21985946&aid=1]",

Please be aware that \"pushing\" the installation in unattended, silent mode may therefore force an unexpected machine reboot on a user, and schedule such installations accordingly. \n\nThe SPSS Statistics 24.0.0.2 for Windows Fix Pack obeys the same rules documented in the Site and Network License Administrator's Guides regarding \"Extracting the Contents of a Downloaded Installer file\" and \"Pushing an Installation to Windows Computers\". \n\nIn this case: \n\n 1. Download the appropriate installer file to a temporary location on your hard drive. \n 2. Open a command window as the local Administrator account and change directory to the temporary download location. \n 3. Extract the \"SPSSStatistics24.0.0.2Patch.msi\" and locale-specific .mst file into a specified location from the downloaded FixPack installer file, \"24.0-IM-S24STATC-<OS>-FP002.exe\",using the documented \"\/b\" switch: 24.0-IM-S24STATC-<OS>-FP002.exe \/b\"c:\\Stats24002FixPack\" (where <OS> is your operating system) \n 4. You can then copy the two extracted files to a network share for easier distribution. \n 5.

Use the About Statistics 24 menu to verify that 24.0.0.2 is the installed version.\n\n\nIBM SPSS Statistics 24 release is supported on Apple Macintosh OS X 10.10.x (Yosemite) through macOS 10.12.x (Sierra) \n\nGuidelines for unattended\/pushed installations for Macintosh-based clients: \n\nIBM SPSS Statistics 24 FixPack 2 for Mac OS X has a silent (push) installer. To install this FixPack on Mac systems, do the following: \n\n 1. Open the 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Mac-Silent-FP002.dmg disk image and copy the two files to your desktop (or any writable location). \n 2. Open a Terminal window and change directories to the location of the patch installer and installer.properties file. \n 3. Edit the installer.properties file to suit your needs. The USER_INSTALL_DIR parameter must be defined. For example, if the current SPSS Statistics 24 install is in the default \/Applications\/IBM\/SPSS\/Statistics\/24, USER_INSTALL_DIR would be:\n    USER_INSTALL_DIR=\/Applications\/IBM\/SPSS\/Statistics\/24 \n 4. Uncomment and modify other parameters as needed. \n 5. To execute the installer, use the following command:\n    \n    .\/SPSS_Statistics_Installer_Silent.bin -f installer.properties\n\n\nInstallation Linux  1. Download the Fix Pack to a temporary location on your hard drive. \n 2. Ensure that no versions of Statistics are running. \n 3. Open a terminal window and execute the 24.0-IM-S24STATC-Linux8664-FP002.bin executable file as the ‘root’ user. \n 4. Statistics 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Use the Help -> About menu to verify that 24.0.0.2 is the installed version.\n\n\nGuidelines for unattended\/pushed installations for Linux-based clients: The SPSS Statistics 24.0.0.2 for Linux Fix Pack obeys the same rules documented in the Site and Network License Administrator's Guides regarding \"Running a Silent Installation on Mac and Linux Computers\". \n\nNote: Please contact IBM SPSS Technical Support to obtain the appropriate installer.properties file for the Linux platform. \n\nSPSS Statistics Server - 24.0 FP2 Installation Instructions \n\nInstallation Windows \n\n 1. Log in as a local administrator. \n 2. Download the Fix Pack contents to a temporary location. \n 3. Ensure that the same version of Statistics Server is not running, as multiple versions can be installed on the server. \n 4. Run the Statistics Server 24.0.02 Fix Pack executable. \n    Note: you must use \"Run as Administrator\" by first right-clicking on the executable. \n 5. SPSS Statistics Server 24.0.0.2 is ready to run. Check the service name or add\/remove programs, or launch statisticsb and run the SHOW VERSION command to verify 24.0.0.2 as the installed version.\n\n\nInstallation UNIX\/Linux Note: On UNIX and Linux, the Statistics Server upgrade is now a true incremental upgrade and not a complete, fresh installation. Installing the Fix Pack for the appropriate platform should be similar to the instructions for installing your server given in the SPSS Statistics Server Installation Instructions. It is suggested to copy off the spssdxcfg.ini prior to the installation on the UNIX \/ Linux server as the installation may remove the R section in spssdxcfg.ini and may require manual updating after FP2 installation \n\n 1. Download the Fix Pack to a directory on the server machine. \n 2. Shut down Statistics Server prior to applying the Fix Pack. \n 3. You need to ensure the ownership and permissions for the \/bin, \/lib and \/common subdirectories of the Statistics installation directory. For example, if you installed as root, to change the ownership and permissions, go to Statistics installation directory and run the following commands at the UNIX prompt: \n    \n    chown -R root:root bin lib commonchmod -R 777 bin lib common \n 4. When running SPSS Statistics Server with internal authentication, a regular user can be the owner of these directories. Refer to the SPSS Statistics Server Administrator’s Guide for more information. \n 5. The Fix Pack can be installed silently using the installer.properties file that comes with the 24.0 release (on the DVD): .\/<installer_name> -f installer.properties where <installer_name> is the installer .bin file that you ftp'ed to the server. \n 6. You can also execute the installer directly to launch a graphical version of the installer. (Note: You will need an X Window System to do so): .\/<installer_name>\n    Note for graphical installer: You should change the default installer directory for the patch in the Install Wizard to point it to the directory on the server where Statistics Server 24.0 is installed. \n 7.

This is to reduce the number of trips back and forth to the database. \n\n\nSYMPTOM\nIf defaultRowPrefetch is set as a custom property on the datasource, this will not work as the defaultRowPrefetch is not a datasource property but a property on the connection itself .\n\n\nCAUSE\ndefaultRowPrefetch is a property of the connection and not of the datasource\n\nENVIRONMENT\nWebSphere Application Server using an Oracle JDBC driver\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nCustomer sets this property and does not see it work. This may result in longer times to getting the full result set and more round trips to the database.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe Oracle defaultRowPrefetch can be set in an attempt to speed up queries to a database that return multiple rows. But, it cannot be set as a custom property in a datasource. Please see below:\n\nThe way to set this connection property is as follows:. \n\n\n\n\nYou cannot set defaultRowPrefetch as a JVM property.

It is strongly recommended to review the platform information on IBM Software Product Compatibility Reports [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/prodguid\/v1r0\/clarity\/index.jsp]. The installation of IBM SPSS Statistics software on Apple Macintosh OSX operating systems requires an Intel processor. \n\nA) Apple Macintosh MacOS High Sierra (10.13) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 only. Please note that no other SPSS release will be officially supported on High Sierra, but older versions like SPSS Statistics 24 may run as well on High Sierra. \n\nNOTE: There's a known issue with some of the earlier release of Mac High Sierra system (13.0 and 13.1 beta version). \nThe top menu of SPSS 25 may disappear if the Mac OS system is set to Non-English. \nThe official MacOSX 10.13.1 version do not have this issue. So, if you encountert this issue you need to update your Mac OS version to latest official 10.13.1 build from Apple. \n\n \n\nB) Apple Macintosh MacOS Sierra (10.12) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and IBM SPSS Statistics 24 only. For release 24 It is also recommended to install the latest FixPack 2 for release 24 on Mac [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24043574]. [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg24042675] \n\nNo older SPSS Statistics releases are supported on Sierra. \n\n \n\nC) Apple Macintosh OSX El Capitan (10.11) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 24. Please see the Release notes - IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27047057] for known issues on Macintosh. \n\nFull documentation including installation material provided in different languages and manuals for release 24 can be found on IBM SPSS Statistics 24 Documentation [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg27047033] webpage. \n\n \n\nAlso, Support for IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Note: if you want to install on El Capitan, please refer to technote 1970391 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21970391] \n\n \n\nD) Apple Macintosh OSX Yosemite (10.10) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 24, IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 \n\n \n\nNote: Mac OSX 10.10 (Yosemite) was released on Thursday, October 16th 2014 by Apple after Statistics 22 was released. If you like to use Statistics 22 on Yosemite you need to install Statistics 22 Fixpack 2 as well. Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and release Statistics 23 are fully tested on Yosemite OSX 10.10. So if you like to run Statistics 22 on Yosemite please install Statistics 22 FixPack 2 and also read the section below: \n\n**** \n\nIn some instances it can be necessary to re-install the legacy Apple Java 6 on 10.10 for the use of Statistics 22 FixPack 2 on this platform\n\nDownload and re-install Apple Java 6 \n\n- After you upgraded your Apple Mac OSX from a previous release to 10.10, Apple Java 6 may no longer exists on your upgraded system. If you then launch Statistics 22 which is an application that relies on Java 6, it can happen, the Mac OS pops up a dialog box stating Java 6 was requested, but none is present.\n- The Java dialog has a \"More Info\" button, which when clicked opens a browser to an Apple Tech Support page for Apple Java 2014-001. A download link is provided:\nhttp:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/dl1572 [http:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/dl1572]\n- Click on the download link and a DMG containing the Java 6 installer is downloaded.\n- Then you open the Java DMG, double click on the Java installer, follow the prompts and complete the installation of Java 6.\n\n******* \n\n \n\nE) Apple Macintosh OSC Mavericks (10.9) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 23 and IBM SPSS Statistics 22 \n\n*** \n\nNote: IBM SPSS Statistics 22 was developed and released prior to Apple's release of OS X 10.9 (Mavericks). However, Statistics 22 can be installed on Mac OSX 10.9 if you install Apple Java SE 6 (1.6.0_65) on OS X 10.9 first before you install Statistics 22. Please see http:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/dl1572 [http:\/\/support.apple.com\/kb\/dl1572] for download. \n\n**** \n\nF) Apple Macintosh OSX Mountain Lion (10.8) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 22 and IBM SPSS Statistics 21 \n\n**** \n\nG) Apple Macintosh OSX Lion (10.7) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 21 \n\n \n\nH) Apple Macintosh OSX Snow Leopard (10.6) \n\nSupport for IBM SPSS Statistics 21 \n\n \n\nOlder SPSS Statistics releases 18 and 19 and 20: \n\nPlease note that SPSS Statistics releases 18, 19 and 20 are no longer supported by IBM.

    "question": "How do I tell when there are mismatched MQ jars in my application server?\nMismatched jar files can cause strange and unpredictable errors when using the MQ JMS classes from a .war file.",
    "ground_truth": "1. Remove any MQ jar files bundled with the Java EE application.\n   If your Java EE application, which may be in the form of an .ear or .war file, includes a copy of any MQ jar files, you should remove those jar files.\n2. Rely on the MQ Resource Adapter for MQ jar files.\n   After removing the bundled MQ jar files, use the MQ jar files provided by the installed MQ Resource Adapter instead.",
    "reference_doc": "IBM Solving IBM MQ Java code version mismatches using the mqjavalist.sh script - United States\n\nWebSphere MQ WMQ TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n When Java™ SE applications and Java EE application servers such as WebSphere Application Server do not use a consistent set of MQ Java archives, applications can fail in unpredictable ways. If WebSphere Application Server notices a mismatch, it issues this message: \"MQJCA1008 The WebSphere MQ classes for JMS were found in the class path but were not the correct version. This error can occur if the application server finds an earlier version of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS in the class path. The error can also occur if you do not configure WebSphere Application Server to use the correct version of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS.\" \n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe mqjavalist.sh script runs on Linux and UNIX systems and can identify Java archives and classes from MQ V5.3 and later versions. Although the mqjavalist.sh script does not run on Windows systems, it is possible to zip up a directory structure on Windows in order to examine it with mqjavalist.sh on a different system. To use the mqjavalist.sh script, download it from the bottom of this page, copy it to the target system, and make the script executable. Make sure that either the unzip command or the Java jar command is available in your PATH before running mqjavalist.sh. For example:\n\n\n\n 1. Preparing to run mqjavalist.sh\n 2. \n 3.  sh> chmod +x mqjavalist.sh \n    sh> PATH=$PATH:\/opt\/java7\/bin \n    \n\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nIBM MQ ships a number of Java archives (jar files) that applications use to connect to MQ and work with messages. For Java EE environments, MQ provides a Resource Adapter called wmq.jmsra.rar which contains the jar files required by JMS applications. Java SE and Java EE applications must use a consistent set of MQ jar files at the same maintenance level, or else they might experience a wide variety of problems including intermittent errors, performance problems, and other failures.\n\nIt is common to find multiple versions of the MQ jar files in the Java CLASSPATH, or invalidly bundled in Java applications (.ear, .war, and .jar files). Finding and eliminating duplicate copies of the MQ jar files can be a difficult task, but the mqjavalist.sh script simplifies that task on Linux and UNIX systems.\n\n\n\n * Syntax\n * Examples\n * WebSphere Application Server\n * Sample output\n * Resolving problems\n * Download\n\n\n\nSYNTAX\n\n 1.  mqjavalist.sh -? | -h \n 2.  \n 3.  mqjavalist.sh [-v] [-r] [-f File] -d Directory ...\n 4.  \n 5.  \n 6.  \n 7.  -?:\n 8.  \n 9.  \n 10. -h:\n 11. \n 12. \n 13. -v:\n 14. \n 15. \n 16. -r:\n 17. \n 18. \n 19. -f File​:\n 20. \n 21. \n 22. -d Directory:\n 23. \n 24. \n 25. \n 26. \n 27. \n 28. The mqjavalist.sh script can take several minutes to complete, depending on the number of Java archives to search and whether you perform a recursive examination of archive files. While running, the script regularly prints its status and the percentage of work completed.\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nEXAMPLES\n\n 1.

Except as noted below, the copies of the MQ jar files should match the versions listed on this page [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21248089].

Otherwise, the application servers in that profile will use the old MQ Resource Adapter jars under the profile installedConnectors\/wmq.jmsra.rar directory rather than the MQ jars in the main installedConnectors\/wmq.jmsra.rar directory, which are kept up to date by WebSphere Application Server fix packs.\n\n\n 1.

Back to top\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\nReview the output from mqjavalist.sh to determine where copies of the MQ jar files have been found. Not all duplicates represent a problem, unless they are being loaded by your Java SE application or Java EE application server at runtime. If the com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar file shows an implementation version of ${version.number} - ${build.level} just ignore it.\n\nIn the sample output above, entries #16 through #27 represent the jar files for the installed MQ Resource Adapter. They all show an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1 except for #21, com.ibm.mqjms.jar, which shows an implementation version of 7.0.1.5 - k701-105-110419. Because the jar file versions are not in sync, MQ JMS will not function as expected.\n\nIn cases like this, the wmq.jmsra.rar file should contain a copy of the MQ jar at the right level for the application server. Entry #14 in the mqjavalist.sh output shows the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file with an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1, which is what we need. Use the jar program to extract the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file from the wmq.jmsra.rar archive, then copy it over the back-level version of the jar. Use chown and chmod to ensure the permissions on the file are correct.\n\nIn other cases, you might find that the classpath for the application server, or for your Java SE application, is picking up extra copies of the MQ jar files. Eliminating unnecessary classpath entries can resolve the problem.\n\nIf your Java EE application (.ear or .war) bundles a copy of any MQ jar files, you should remove them and rely on the ones from the installed MQ Resource Adapter instead.\n\nBack to top\n\n\nAdditional Keywords: \ntroubleshoot troubleshooting trouble shoot classloader classpath configuration scripts\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD\n 1. \n 2. mqjavalist.sh [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21681142&amp;aid=2]mqjavalist.sh\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: All source code and\/or binaries attached to this document are referred to here as \"the Program\".

It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. \n\nSince Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. \n\nCAUSE\nApplication needs HTTP session time-out set.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: \n\n * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels \n * At the time when the application is packaged \n * In the application code\n\n\nSetting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console \n1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. \n\n\n2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. \n\n\n3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n          <session-config> \n      *          <session-timeout>60<\/session-timeout>\n * \n *       <\/session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. \n\nHTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary \n\nThe list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. \n\n1. Server Level [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Lowest level 2. Enterprise Application [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21163875&amp;aid=1] Overrides the Server Level if Override is selected 3.

Installation Manager is installed in user mode through root user\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe upgrade must be initiated by using the attached script, which gives the non-root user (who originally installed this Jazz for Service Management instance) the correct permissions for the upgrade process. \n\n\nThe script takes two mandatory arguments and one optional argument.\n\nUsage: .\/JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh \"IM_Install_Location\" \n\"JazzSM_Install_Location [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEKCU_1.1.3.0\/com.ibm.psc.doc\/ref\/psc_r_pathnames.html]\"\"[Response_file_with_absolute_Path]\"\n\nFor example (showing default installation paths): .\/JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh \"\/home\/root\/IBM\/InstallManager\/\" \"\/opt\/IBM\/JazzSM\/\" \"\/opt\/Download\/dash_upgrade_rsp.xml\"\n\n\nFor IM GUI mode installation, provide the 2 mandatory arguments; IM_Install_Location and JazzSM_Install_Location. \nThis argument combination invokes Installation Manager in GUI mode and lead you through the rest of the upgrade process.\n\nFor IM Silent installation, provide all 3 arguments; IM_Install_Location , JazzSM_Install_Location, and Response_file_with_absolute_Path.\nThis argument combination invokes Installation Manager in silent mode to upgrade JazzSM.\n\nJazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21985946&aid=2]JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21985946&aid=1]",

Use fileServingEnabled=\"true\" in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file.\n   This configuration will enable the serving of static files such as JPG, GIF, CSS, JS, etc., from your web application.\n2. This will cause the plug-in to use a wildcard entry for the context-root of your web application.\n   ",
    "reference_doc": "IBM How to serve static files from both IBM HTTP Server and an application in WebSphere Application Server - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How can I configure IBM HTTP Server (IHS), and the IBM web server Plug-in, and my web application running in WebSphere Application Server (WAS), to serve some of my static files (JPG, GIF, CSS, JS, etc) from the IHS web server, but serve other static files from my web app running in WAS? \n\nCAUSE\nThe \"fileServingEnabled\" property in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file in the web application, is like an ON \/ OFF switch.\nA setting of fileServingEnabled=\"true\" means that ALL static files will be served from the web application in WAS only. In this case, the plug-in config will use a wildcard with the application context-root like \"\/myapp\/*\". That way every URL starting with \/myapp\/* will be routed to the application in WAS.\n\nOn the other hand, fileServingEnabled=\"false\" means NO static files will be served from the application in WAS. In this case, a wildcard will NOT be used in the plugin-cfg.xml file. Instead, there will be several URI entries matching the URL-Patterns from <servlet-mappings> in the web.xml, like \"\/myapp\/servlet1\" and \"\/myapp\/index.jsp\". Requests for dynamic content matching the URI entries in the Plug-in config, will be routed to the application in WAS. But everything else (static content) will be handled by the IHS web server itself.\n\n\nANSWER\nIf you want to serve any static files (JPG, GIF, CSS, JS, etc) from your web application in WAS, you must use fileServingEnabled=\"true\" in the ibm-web-ext.xmi file. That will cause the plug-in to use a wildcard entry for the context-root of your web application. For example, if the context-root is \"myapp\", then there will be a URI entry for \"\/myapp\/*\" in the plug-in config, and everything starting with \"myapp\" will be routed to the application in WAS. \n\n\nNow, if you also want to be able to serve some of the static files from the IHS web server itself, you will need to do a trick using RewriteRule in the IHS config. Here is how the trick works:\n\n1) Create a subdirectory called \"static\" under the IHS DocumentRoot directory. And put the static files that you want IHS to serve into that directory. For example in the IHS document root directory (HTTPServer\/htdocs\/) create a subdirectory called \"static\". Something like this:\n\/usr\/IBM\/HTTPServer\/htdocs\/static\/\n\n2) In your web application, you will reference those files using relative references like \"static\/picture.jpg\", or \"static\/mystyles.css\".\n\nThose relative references will be interpreted as URLs like this:\n\/myapp\/static\/picture.jpg\n\/myapp\/static\/mystyles.css\n\nKeep in mind that there really is NOT any \"static\" subdirectory in the application. But that is ok.\n\n3) Now, in the IHS config, you must use RewriteCond and RewriteRule to watch for these references, and redirect to get them from IHS. For example, look at these directives...\n\n<ifModule mod_rewrite.c>\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteRule ^\/myapp\/static\/(.*) \/static\/$1 [PT]\n<\/ifModule>\n\nIt means, if the URI begins with \/myapp\/static\/* then IHS will rewrite it to just \/static\/* and \"pass-through\". Since \/static\/* does NOT match anything in the Plug-in config, the request will be handled by IHS, and the file will be served from the static directory under IHS DocumentRoot.\n\nTo the user looking at the URL in the browser they will see this:\n\/hostname\/myapp\/static\/picture.jpg\n\nBut, the file will really be served by IHS from here:\n\/hostname\/static\/picture.jpg\n\nHere is another example:\n\nIf you just want to match and serve *.gif files from IHS, use:\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \\.(gif)$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^\/myapp\/(.*) \/static\/$1 [PT]\n\nIf you just want to match and serve *.gif, *.css and *.js files from IHS, use:\n\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} \\.(gif|css|js)$ [NC]\nRewriteRule ^\/myapp\/(.*) \/static\/$1 [PT]\n\nWhich assumes the files themselves are placed in [IHS_DOC_ROOT]\/static\/.\n\n4) For the static files in the application, you will need to put them in some other directory that is NOT called \"static\", for example \"images\/sunset.jpg\" would be a directory and file in the myapp application. This URL request, would be handled by the Plug-in and sent to the application in WAS:\nhostname\/myapp\/images\/sunset.jpg\n\n\nSo, by using the trick described above, some static files will be served from IHS, like:\n\/hostname\/myapp\/static\/picture.jpg\n\nBut other static files will be served from the web application running in WAS, like:\n\/hostname\/myapp\/images\/sunset.jpg",

I have not yet run database-transfer to copy the data from the Derby database to a DB2, Oracle, or SQL Server database. I don't wish to transfer to an external database and I have a need to run a SQL query against a table or two in the Derby database to troubleshoot an issue. \r\nHow can I perform this action?",

    "reference_doc": "IBM Using dblook and ij to work with the embedded Apache Derby in WebSphere Portal - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n IBM WebSphere Portal 6.1 uses an embedded version of Apache Derby out of the box. However, there is no longer a graphical tool such as CloudView (as with Cloudscape 5.x). In order to obtain the data and structure of the WebSphere Portal database, dblook and ij utilities can be used to accomplish such goals. \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\nBefore proceeding with the following, it is strongly recommended that you back up your Derby database. Make a copy of <wp_profile>\/PortalServer\/derby\/wpsdb to a backup directory. Since the version of Derby used in WebSphere Portal is embedded, you must stop the Portal server before you can access the database although you can always work on the backup copy.\n\nNOTE: For simplicity, we will omit the extension of the utilities. You should add \".sh\" or \".bat' depending on the platform.\n\nThere are three primary utility tools that are installed with WebSphere 6.1, \"dblook\", \"ij\", and \"sysinfo\", under the <was_root>\/AppServer\/derby\/bin\/embedded directory. The sysinfo utility generates information about the operating system, the Java version and classpath, and the Derby driver files and version information.\n\ndblook utility\nThe dblook utility is used to view the database structure (in DDL - Data Definition Language) for a specific database. \n\nThe usage is dblook -d <databaseURL> [options], where databaseURL is in the \"jdbc:derby:<database>\" format. The <database> should be given as a full path, such as C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\derby\\wpsdb. \n\nCommonly used options include: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * Examples:\n * \n * \n * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\PortalServer\\wpsdb -o C:\\temp\\wpsdb_ddl.sql\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\PortalServer\\wpsdb -z release -o C:\\temp\\wpsdb_ddl.sql\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * dblook -d jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\PortalServer\\wpsdb -z release -t user_desc -verbose -o C:\\temp\\user_desc.sql\n * \n * \n\n\nij utility \nThe ij utility is a command line SQL processor. It can be used to run DDL for creating database, tables, indexes, and so on. In a WebSphere Portal environment, it would typically be used for exporting data or making simple changes (when advised by IBM Support). \n\nTo start ij, simply open a command prompt or terminal window, change the directory and enter the command. You should then see the ij shell with prompt \"ij>\". \n\nThe following are some common commands that you may use when reviewing data in the Portal database.  * \n * ij> connect 'jdbc:derby:C:\\IBM\\WebSphere\\wp_profile\\derby\\wpsdb';\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> show connections;\n * \n * \n *  CONNECTION0* - jdbc:derby:C:\\ibm\\websphere\\wp_profile\\portalserver\\derby\\wpsdb \n   * = current connection \n   ij> driver \"org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver'; \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> set schema=release;\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> select * from user_desc where oid=1000;\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> run 'myquery.sql';\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_TABLE('RELEASE','USER_DESC','USER_DESC.SQL',';','|',NULL);\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ij> \n * CALL SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_EXPORT_QUERY('SELECT * FROM RELEASE.USER_DESC','user_desc_query.sqlL',null,'|',NULL);\n * \n * \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Derby utility from Apache [http:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/javadb\/10.3.3.0\/getstart\/cgsusingtoolsutils.html]\nDerby SQL references from Apache [http:\/\/db.apache.org\/derby\/docs\/10.1\/ref\/crefsqlj23296.html]\n\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Organizational Productivity- Portals & Collaboration WebSphere Portal End of Support Products AIX, HP-UX, IBM i, Linux, Solaris, Windows, z\/OS 7.0, 6.1",

    "reference_doc": "IBM How to set an appropriate number of Portal Datasource connections in WebSphere Portal - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\nFor a given maximum number of Portal WebContainer threads set, what should I set my maximum Portal datasource connections to? \n\nANSWER\nWhen tuning WebSphere Portal at version 6.0 and beyond, one of the concerns that arises is how should one tune the maximum number of Portal datasources. Portal can and does make heavy internal use of datasources, so miscalculating this (maximum) value can have a significant impact on system behavior. Out of the box, the default maximum setting is 50. This may or may not be sufficient for any given system. \n\nEach Portal request may make any number of database (DB) requests ranging for none to several.. Further, customized portlets and PPR (Parallel Portlet Rendering) may cause several concurrent DB requests. By default, the maximum number of WebContainer threads is also set to 50. Therefore the ratio between the maximum number of Portal datasource connections to the maximum number of Portal WebContainer threads is 1:1. Support has found that this ratio is often too low for the best performance. In the past, there have been recommendations of this ratio as high as of 2:1 or even 2.5:1. \n\nHowever, these values caused concern in large deployments where the TOTAL number of maximum datasource connections might start to place a strain on backend resources. Recent analysis suggests that these ratio values may be safely reduced to 1.25: 1 for all Portal datasource, with the exception of the jcrDB when WCM is used extensively. In this case, we recommend a ratio of 1.5:1 \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nFor example, if your system's \n\nMaximum number of WebContainer threads is 100 \n\nthen you should set your \n\nMaximum number of Portal datasource connections to 125 \n\nfor each Portal datasource. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \n\nIf during Runtime, you should find that your running out of Portal Datasource connections, you may go ahead and increase the ratio up to 2:1. Please be aware of how this might impact your backend resources and be sure to scale your database accordingly. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\nTo find the number of WebContainer threads that are running in any particular Portal server, use the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console and go to the following location: \n\nServers ---> Application Servers --> WebSphere_Portal (your server) --> Thread Pools --> WebContainer \n\n \n\nTo find the Data Source setting for your Portal datasources, use the WebSphere Application Server Admin Console to go to the following location: \n\nResources ---> Data Sources ---> wpdbDB (for example) --> Connection pools \n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

The \"cacheTime\" variable controls this, which is set to -1 by default. If the number of TIP roles is high, it can cause Java OOM errors. \n\nSYMPTOM\nTIP hangs.

This normally will give the system good runtime performance. However, in cases where a large number of user\/role mappings are defined, the system may run into Java memory issues causing Java OutOfMemory outages.\n\nThe cacheTime we are talking about here is Argus cache. The is used for the way the role authorizations are stored in memory by Argus and nothing related to LDAP or SSO. The Argus cache time by default we ship with in TIP is -1 which means the cache will not get cleaned up till we re-start the server. \n\nError from the <TIP_HOME>\/profiles\/TIPProfile\/logs\/server1\/SystemOut.log\n\n[10\/2\/13 9:27:54:838 CDT] 0000002a webapp E com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp.WebApp logServletError SRVE0293E: \n[Servlet Error]-[\/secure\/isclite\/tiles\/nop.jsp]: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at java.lang.Object.clone(Native Method)\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nall environments\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nJava heapdump files will be created in the <TIP_HOME>\/profiles\/TIPProfile directory. \n\nheapdump.20131022.144244.20034001.phd \n\nThe Systemout.log will have have errors similar to this: \n\n\n[10\/2\/13 9:27:54:838 CDT] 0000002a webapp E com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.webapp.WebApp logServletError SRVE0293E: \n[Servlet Error]-[\/secure\/isclite\/tiles\/nop.jsp]: java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space at java.lang.Object.clone(Native Method) \n\n\nUsing the memory heap dump analysis shows that Argus is the problem, specifically the instance shown inside the red line in the output of the Java memory analyzer below: \n\n \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21657452&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21657452&aid=1]\n\nYou can also check the cacheTime variable in the <TIP_HOME>\/profiles\/TIPProfile\/config\/cells\/TIPCell\/commonauthz\/config.xml file to confirm if it's set to \"-1\", which means the Argus cache will not get cleaned up unless the TIP server is restarted.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe cacheTime value in config.xml is in milliseconds. TIP is shipped with the initial value of -1, which means the Argus cache will not be cleared out unless TIP restart. To resolve this issue you need to configure 'cacheTime' to non -1 value. Initially we suggest setting the value to 1200000, which is 20 minutes. After the change you will have to restart the TIP server, normally server1. \n\nNOTE: The cacheTime variable was added in TIP version 2.2.0.0.",

    "question": "How can we change the password for LDAP bind user?\nWe need to change our LDAP bind user due to security requirement. Is there any documentation for the procedure?",
    "ground_truth": "1. Follow a coordinated update procedure when needing to change the user account and\/or password.\n   This coordinated update procedure should be applied specifically to FileNet Content Engine versions 4.x and above.",
    "reference_doc": "IBM Procedure to change the username and\/or password for the FileNet Content Engine  Directory Service Account, including the bootstrap user - United States\n\nchange; user; password; fem; directory service; bootstrapconfig; bootstrap user TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do you change the user and\/or password for Directory Service Account used by the Content Engine? \n\nANSWER\nThe Directory Service user account and password are normally used in two product components: FileNet Enterprise Manager (FEM), and the application server. A coordinated update procedure should be followed when there is a need to change the user account and\/or password. This procedure applies to FileNet Content Engine 4.x and above. \n\n * \n * Note: \n * \n * \n\n\nIf the same user account is also used as the CE Bootstrap user, the corresponding user in the BootstrapConfig.properties needs to change as well. For changing the GCD admin user\/password in BootstrapConfig.properties specifically, refer to this documentation: \nhttp:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/p8docs\/v4r5m1\/index.jsp?topic=\/com.ibm.p8.doc\/admin\/security\/sec_how_change_bootstrap_pwd.htm [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/p8docs\/v4r5m1\/index.jsp?topic=\/com.ibm.p8.doc\/admin\/security\/sec_how_change_bootstrap_pwd.htm] \n\n\n1. Launch FEM and the application server's administrative console. \na. Login to FEM using the Directory Service account. \nb. Login to the application server administrative console with an administrator account. \n\nImportant: Do not close above two applications until you have completed step 5 below. \n\n\n2. Make LDAP account changes: \na. Change the password for an existing account on the LDAP server - Using LDAP interface, change the password for the CE Directory Service account. \nOR \nb. Create a new user account on the LDAP server for the CE Directory Service account. \n\n\n3. Add new user (if applicable), to FEM \nIf the bind user is also the CE admin user, then the bind user will need to be added to all the existing objects in the P8 domain. Please read Update object store with new users and groups [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/p8docs\/v4r5m1\/index.jsp?topic=\/com.ibm.p8.doc\/admin\/security\/sec_how_update_os.htm] for instructions \n\n\n4. Change Directory Configuration bind user in FEM \nUsing FEM (step 1a above), go to Domain properties > Directory Configuration > Select Directory Configuration > click on the Modify button > General Tab: \na. Modify the Directory Service User with new user's full distinguish name (DN) \nb. Click on Change password check box > change to a new password > click OK. \n\nAt this point you will be presented a dialog box with following message: \n“These changes require the application server to be restarted. Please restart the application server to incorporate these changes” \n\nclick OK > click OK \n\nImportant: Do not restart the application server until you have completed step 5 below. \n\n\n5. Change the user in the application server's directory configuration \n\n- For Websphere, in the WebSphere Administrative Console, go to Global Security > click on Configure under User Account Repository > Modify Bind Distinguished Name (DN) > Modify Bind Password > click OK and Save changes \n\n- For WebLogic go to Security Realms > myrealm > Providers > ldap provider and click on \"Provider Specific\" tab in WebLogic Admin Console. Change \"Principal\" and \"Credential\". \n\n- For JBoss go to <JBoss Home>\\server\\<CE Server>\\conf directory and edit \"login-config.xml\". \nFind \"FileNet\" application-policy and in login module change bindDN\/bindCredential. \n\n\n6. Changing the CE Bootstrap user \n\nFor CE 4.5.x and above: \na. In the Configure Bootstrap Properties task, set the Bootstrap Operation property to Modify Existing. \nb. Confirm that the Bootstrapped EAR file property contains the path to the bootstrap file you need to edit. \nc. Change the Bootstrap user password. Use Configuration Manager's features to save and run the task. \nd. Run Configuration Manager's Deploy Application. \n\nFor CE 4.0: \nNote: This step is needed only if the GCD user name is the same as the Directory Service account. Note that the example below is for a Windows environment. \n\n- For WebSphere \na. Open command prompt window, go to folder where EAR file reside (it differs depending on CE version). For example, in CE 4.5.1, go to \"<CE Home> \\ tools \\ configure \\ profiles \\ <profile> \\ ear\" \nb. Backup Engine-ws.ear \nc. Execute the command below: \n\njava –jar “c:\\program files\\FileNet\\ContentEngine\\lib\\BootStrapConfig.jar” –e Engine-ws.ear --username <username> --password <password> \n\nd. Since the Engine-ws.ear file has been deployed in the WebSphere's installedApps path, the Bootstrap file need to be copied to the path manually. Extract the props.jar file from the ear file by utility such as Winzip, copy the props.jar file to theinstalledApps location - “<WebSphere Home>\\ AppServer\\ profiles \\ <profile name> \\ InstalledApps \\<serverNodecell> \\ FileNetEngine.ear \\ APP-INF \\ lib \\\" \n\nNote that an alternative to copying the props.jar file is to uninstall and re-install the updated ear file in WebSphere. \n\n- For WebLogic \na. Open command prompt window, go to folder - \"<WebLogic home> \\ user_projects \\ domains \\ <domain> \\ servers \" \nb. Backup FileNetEngine.ear \nc. Execute the command below: \n\njava –jar “c:\\program files\\FileNet\\ContentEngine\\lib\\BootStrapConfig.jar” –e Engine-wl.ear --username <username> --password <password> \n\n- For JBoss \na. Open command prompt window, go to folder - \"<JBoss Home> \\ server \\ <server> \\ deploy \\\" \nb. Backup FileNetEngine.ear \nc. Execute the command below: \n\njava –jar “c:\\program files\\FileNet\\ContentEngine\\lib\\BootStrapConfig.jar” –e Engine-jb.ear --username <username> --password <password> \n\n\n7. Remove cached files in the application server \n- Close FileNet Enterprise Manager (Step 1a) \n- Close Administrative Console (Step 1b) \n- Stop the application server \n- Remove the cached FileNetEngine directory in the application server. \nFor example, the default windows path on Websphere 6.0 is \n\"C:\\program files\\Websphere\\AppServer\\profiles\\<profile name>\\temp\\<server node>\\ \n<server>\\FileNetEngine\" \n\n\n8. Restart the application server, and login to FEM using the new user and password. \n\n\n9. Troubleshooting \n\nIf CE fails to start due to mistakes in the above procedures, you may not be able to redo the change through these procedures because FEM will fail to run. \nIn this case, you can do the following: \n\n- Back out the change made to the GCD database in step 3 by deleting the latest row in the FNGCD table. \n- Back out the change made to the application server in step 4 by redoing the procedure with the previous user. \n- Back out the change made to the BootstrapConfig.properties file's GCD user by using the backup EAR file \n- Restart the application server, and login to FEM using the previous user.",

    "reference_doc": "IBM SqlException with message \"Caught java.io.CharConversionException.\" and ERRORCODE=-4220 - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n When an application uses the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ (also known as the JCC driver) and is connected to a database with code set UTF-8 (code page 1208), it throws an\nSqlException with message including \"Caught java.io.CharConversionException\" and ERRORCODE=-4220 if the data in a character column that it queries contains a sequence of bytes that is not a valid UTF-8 string. \n\nSYMPTOM\nAn exception is thrown similar to this: \n\n com.ibm.db2.jcc.am.SqlException: [jcc][t4][1065][12306][XXX.XXX.XXX] Caught java.io.CharConversionException. See attached Throwable for details. ERRORCODE=-4220, SQLSTATE=null\n[...]\nCaused by: java.nio.charset.MalformedInputException: Input length = XXX\n[...]\nCaused by: sun.io.MalformedInputException\nat sun.io.ByteToCharUTF8.convert(ByteToCharUTF8.java:XXX)\n[...]\n\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe JCC driver throws the exception when data in a character column that it queries is not a valid string in the database code page.\n\nThe invalid data could have been input to the database in the following ways:\n\n\n * By running an SQL statement which writes byte values to the database. For example: INSERT INTO tab1 VALUES (X'C3')\n\n * By running the IMPORT or LOAD commands for files which contain character data that is not in the code page of the client machine, so the appropriate code page conversion was not done. To make sure that the the appropriate code page conversion is done when running IMPORT or LOAD, specify the code page of the input file by including the \"codepage=x\" file type modifier (specifying the code page in place of x).\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nYou can use the HEX function to find out what are the byte values in a character column. \n\nFor example, to find out the byte values in column COL1 in table TAB1, run: \nSELECT HEX(col1) FROM tab1\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nUpdate the invalid data with a valid UTF-8 character string. \n\n\nAlternatively, for JCC driver versions that support it you can set the JCC configuration property db2.jcc.charsetDecoderEncoder=3 so that instead of throwing an exception the JCC driver returns the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER (U+FFFD) in place of a sequence of bytes that is not a valid UTF-8 string. \nThe JCC configuration property db2.jcc.charsetDecoderEncoder is supported in versions of the JCC driver that come with DB2 LUW 9.5 Fix Pack 8 and later (APAR IC74896), DB2 LUW 9.7 Fix Pack 5 and later (APAR IC74895), and all DB2 LUW releases from DB2 10.1 onwards.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a Java program MyApp.java that executes an SQL query of a database column that contains a sequence of bytes that is not a valid string.\nWhen you run:\njava MyApp\nit throws an exception. But when you run:\njava -Ddb2.jcc.charsetDecoderEncoder=3 MyApp\nit returns the string with any invalid sequence of bytes replaced by the Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER. \n\nThe Unicode REPLACEMENT CHARACTER often appears like this \n(a diamond with a question mark inside it) : [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21684365&amp;aid=1]\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n APAR IC78495 [https:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IC74895]\nAPAR IC74896 [https:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IC74896]\nMaking the setting for IBM Data Studio [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21612346]\nMaking the setting for IBM Content Collector [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSAE9L_4.0.0\/com.ibm.content.collector.doc_kc\/troubleshooting\/ts_afu_java_throws_exception.dita]\nUDF to identify invalid data in a UTF-8 character colum [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21608985]\nHow invalid data can get into a UTF-8 character column [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21412846]\nLOAD command [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEPGG_10.5.0\/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc\/doc\/r0008305.html]\nIMPORT command [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEPGG_10.5.0\/com.ibm.db2.luw.admin.cmd.doc\/doc\/r0008304.html]\nHEX function [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSEPGG_10.5.0\/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc\/doc\/r0000811.html]",

This needs to be configured on each JDBC Provider. You cannot isolate only one resource provider, all the provider configurations in different scopes will have to be configured with the \"Isolate this resource provider\" setting. In this scenario, the resource provider classes from different versions of the jars are not imported or accessed to verify if the isolation has indeed worked.

    "question": "How do I tell when there are mismatched MQ jars in my application server?\nMismatched jar files can cause strange and unpredictable errors when using the MQ JMS classes.",
    "ground_truth": "1. Use the mqjavalist.sh script.\n   The mqjavalist.sh script simplifies the process of finding and eliminating duplicate copies of the MQ jar files on Linux and UNIX systems.",
    "reference_doc": "IBM Solving IBM MQ Java code version mismatches using the mqjavalist.sh script - United States\n\nWebSphere MQ WMQ TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n When Java™ SE applications and Java EE application servers such as WebSphere Application Server do not use a consistent set of MQ Java archives, applications can fail in unpredictable ways. If WebSphere Application Server notices a mismatch, it issues this message: \"MQJCA1008 The WebSphere MQ classes for JMS were found in the class path but were not the correct version. This error can occur if the application server finds an earlier version of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS in the class path. The error can also occur if you do not configure WebSphere Application Server to use the correct version of the WebSphere MQ classes for JMS.\" \n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe mqjavalist.sh script runs on Linux and UNIX systems and can identify Java archives and classes from MQ V5.3 and later versions. Although the mqjavalist.sh script does not run on Windows systems, it is possible to zip up a directory structure on Windows in order to examine it with mqjavalist.sh on a different system. To use the mqjavalist.sh script, download it from the bottom of this page, copy it to the target system, and make the script executable. Make sure that either the unzip command or the Java jar command is available in your PATH before running mqjavalist.sh. For example:\n\n\n\n 1. Preparing to run mqjavalist.sh\n 2. \n 3.  sh> chmod +x mqjavalist.sh \n    sh> PATH=$PATH:\/opt\/java7\/bin \n    \n\n\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nIBM MQ ships a number of Java archives (jar files) that applications use to connect to MQ and work with messages. For Java EE environments, MQ provides a Resource Adapter called wmq.jmsra.rar which contains the jar files required by JMS applications. Java SE and Java EE applications must use a consistent set of MQ jar files at the same maintenance level, or else they might experience a wide variety of problems including intermittent errors, performance problems, and other failures.\n\nIt is common to find multiple versions of the MQ jar files in the Java CLASSPATH, or invalidly bundled in Java applications (.ear, .war, and .jar files). Finding and eliminating duplicate copies of the MQ jar files can be a difficult task, but the mqjavalist.sh script simplifies that task on Linux and UNIX systems.\n\n\n\n * Syntax\n * Examples\n * WebSphere Application Server\n * Sample output\n * Resolving problems\n * Download\n\n\n\nSYNTAX\n\n 1.  mqjavalist.sh -? | -h \n 2.  \n 3.  mqjavalist.sh [-v] [-r] [-f File] -d Directory ...\n 4.  \n 5.  \n 6.  \n 7.  -?:\n 8.  \n 9.  \n 10. -h:\n 11. \n 12. \n 13. -v:\n 14. \n 15. \n 16. -r:\n 17. \n 18. \n 19. -f File​:\n 20. \n 21. \n 22. -d Directory:\n 23. \n 24. \n 25. \n 26. \n 27. \n 28.

Back to top\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\n\nReview the output from mqjavalist.sh to determine where copies of the MQ jar files have been found. Not all duplicates represent a problem, unless they are being loaded by your Java SE application or Java EE application server at runtime. If the com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar file shows an implementation version of ${version.number} - ${build.level} just ignore it.\n\nIn the sample output above, entries #16 through #27 represent the jar files for the installed MQ Resource Adapter. They all show an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1 except for #21, com.ibm.mqjms.jar, which shows an implementation version of 7.0.1.5 - k701-105-110419. Because the jar file versions are not in sync, MQ JMS will not function as expected.\n\nIn cases like this, the wmq.jmsra.rar file should contain a copy of the MQ jar at the right level for the application server. Entry #14 in the mqjavalist.sh output shows the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file with an implementation version of 7.1.0.0 - k000-L111005.1, which is what we need. Use the jar program to extract the com.ibm.mqjms.jar file from the wmq.jmsra.rar archive, then copy it over the back-level version of the jar. Use chown and chmod to ensure the permissions on the file are correct.\n\nIn other cases, you might find that the classpath for the application server, or for your Java SE application, is picking up extra copies of the MQ jar files. Eliminating unnecessary classpath entries can resolve the problem.\n\nIf your Java EE application (.ear or .war) bundles a copy of any MQ jar files, you should remove them and rely on the ones from the installed MQ Resource Adapter instead.\n\nBack to top\n\n\nAdditional Keywords: \ntroubleshoot troubleshooting trouble shoot classloader classpath configuration scripts\n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD\n 1. \n 2. mqjavalist.sh [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21681142&amp;aid=2]mqjavalist.sh\n\n\n\n\nDISCLAIMER: All source code and\/or binaries attached to this document are referred to here as \"the Program\".

    "reference_doc": "IBM JRules or ODM module fails to access database with StaleConnectionException - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n JRules and ODM modules such as Rule Execution Server (RES) and Rule Team Server (RTS) \/ Decision Center (DC) may fail to access their data source with the following type of exception present in the log:\n\ncom.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException: Io exception: Connection timed out \n\nSYMPTOM\nThe problem may occur when a JRules or ODM module accesses its data source after a period of database access inactivity. For example: \n\n * The first user accessing a RTS \/ DC server that remained idle overnight experiences a failure upon logging and the server log shows an com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException occurred at that time. \n * After a RES server has been processing execution requests normally for some time, an attempt to deploy a ruleset update fails and the server log shows an com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException occurred upon an attempt to invalidate a ruleset or to retrieve its definition.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe underlying network connection for a data source is no longer valid although the data source itself remains considered active from the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool management perspective. An attempt by a JRules module to try and access its data base through one such data source connection provided by the Application Server may then fail. \nThe network connection of a data source may become invalid for a number of reasons, one typical example is that a firewall between the Application Server and the Database has a policy to discard network connections that remain idle for some time.\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe exception com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException is specific to WebSphere Application Server environments. But a similar issue can be experienced with Weblogic, see: Rule Execution Server on WebLogic unable to load ruleset after period of inactivity [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21615801]\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wasinfo\/v7r0\/index.jsp?topic=\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc\/info\/ae\/ae\/udat_conpoolset.html] so as to eliminate occurrences of StaleConnectionException : \n\n * Set the Minimum connections to 0 to avoid situations where a connection is kept in the pool to meet the minimum requirement, even though it may have been idle for longer than Unused timeout \n * Set the values for Unused timeout and Reap timeout so that the sum does not exceed any network level idle connection timeout\n\n\nThe document Troubleshooting stale connection problems [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21247168#SCETroubleshooting] provides further information.

Since trace logs can be quite verbose and include many unrelated errors, resetting the logs and then reproducing the problem issue can reduce the time required for log analysis for specific issues.\n\nANSWER\nSteps to enable tracing: \n\n\nEnable trace logging. \n\n 1. Log into the DASH. After logging in navigate to Console Settings [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21632844&amp;aid=1] > Websphere Administrative Console. \n 2. Navigate to Troubleshooting -> Logs & Trace \n 3. Click on the Server1 -> Select Diagnostic Trace Service. Increase the Maximum Number of Historical Files from 1 to 10. \n 4. Click Apply, then select Change Log Detail Levels. \n 5. Click on Runtime tab to enable tracing for the DASH process that is currently running. Enabling tracing from the Runtime tab will keep tracing active until the next time the DASH server process is stopped. To make tracing persistent even after stopping and restarting the DASH server process click the Configuration tab instead. \n 6. Clear the trace string in the Groups box and replace it with the following:\n    \n    *=info: com.ibm.isc.*=all: com.ibm.isclite.*=all: com.ibm.iscportal.*=all: com.ibm.isclite.service.datastore.consoleproperties.*=INFO\n    \n    For the Connection manager (data provider related issues) you will want to enable all for the following components:\n    \n    *=info: com.ibm.isclite.rest.*=all:com.ibm.tivoli.conmgr.*=all \n 7. Click on the Apply button. \n 8. If you enabled tracing from the Configuration tab in step 4, then click the \"Save\" link that appears at the top of the page. (\"Save to master configuration\")\n\n\nOnce tracing is enabled, reproduce the DASH runtime issue. Note the time that the issue was reproduced so that the issue can be easily correlated with the trace log entries. \n\nRun the log collector program:\n\n\n 1. Change the directory to <JazzSM Home>\/ui\/bin \n 2. Run the following command:\n    \n    .\/consoleLogCollector.sh or .bat\n    \n    Send us the console_logs.zip file located in <JazzSM Home>\/ui directory\n\n\nand attach them to the associated Problem Management Record (PMR). Please include the time the issue was reproduced in the PMR update. Please also provide the DASH version info:\n<JazzSM Home>\/ui\/bin\/consolecli.sh Version\n\nUpload the resulting output file to the PMR",

    "reference_doc": "IBM Recommended values for web server plug-in config - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n In the web server plug-in, what do the LoadBalanceWeight, MaxConnections, ConnectTimeout, ServerIOTimeout, RetryInterval, IgnoreAffinityRequests, and GetDWLMTable options mean and what are the recommended settings for these options?\n\nWhat affect does Session Affinity have?\n\nHow are connections handled during plug-in fail-over?\n\nWhat is the effect of using more than one web server child process? \n\nANSWER\nTo understand how load balancing works in the web server plug-in, see Understanding IBM HTTP Server plug-in Load Balancing in a clustered environment [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21219567].\n\nTo understand how fail-over works in the web server plug-in, see Understanding HTTP plug-in failover in a clustered environment [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21219808].\n\n\nLoadBalanceWeight is a starting \"weight\". The value is dynamically changed by the plug-in during runtime. The \"weight\" of a server (or clone) is lowered each time a request is assigned to that clone. When all weights for all servers drop to 0 or below, the plug-in has to readjust all of the weights so that they are above 0. Using a starting value of only 2 (default), means that the weights will get to 0 very quickly and the plug-in will constantly be readjusting the weights. Therefore, It is recommended to start with a higher LoadBalanceWeight. The IBM WebSphere Application Server administrative console will allow a value up to 20 for this. However, it is certainly possible to manually edit the plugin-cfg.xml file and specify some other value for LoadBalanceWeight that is higher than 20.\n\nNote: At runtime, the LoadBalanceWeight of each appserver in a cluster are normalized by their highest common factor. For example, 100, 90, 80 have a common factor of 10. So, these configured weights would be divided by 10 at runtime, resulting in actual starting weights of only 10, 9, 8. Setting all clones to the same starting LoadBalanceWeight (for example: 20, 20, 20) will result in an actual starting weight of only 1 for each, because of normalization. So, it is recommended to set the weight of at least one of the clones to be off by a value of 1. For example, if there are 3 clones, you might choose the starting LoadBalanceWeights to be: 20, 20, 19. After normalization the weights will be unchanged.\nRecommended values = all clones the same, except one clone off by one (for example: 20, 20, 19)\n\n\nMaxConnections is used to gauge when a server is \"starting to become overwhelmed\". It is not used to determine when to fail-over (mark the server \"down\"). When a request is sent from the plug-in to the WAS appserver, it is called a \"PendingRequest\", until the response comes back. If the application running in WebSphere Application Server is handling requests quickly, each request will only be PENDING for a very short time. So, under ideal conditions, MaxConnections is not needed and therefore the default is (-1) meaning unlimited. However, sometimes an application may start to become overwhelmed and the application may not be able to handle the requests as quickly. Consequently Pending Requests start to build up. MaxConnections can be used to put a limit on the number of PENDING requests per server. When the MaxConnections limit is reached, the plug-in will stop sending requests to that appserver, but it is not marked down. The optimal value for MaxConnections will depend on how quickly the application and appserver respond to each request. If normal responses are returned in less than one second, it may be appropriate to set a low value for MaxConnections, like 20 or so. However, if it normally takes several seconds to get a response from the application, then it would be prudent to use a higher value for MaxConnections, like 100. Please note that if the MaxConnections limit has been reached the plug-in will not send ANY more requests to that server until responses come back for the current PENDING requests, and the pendingRequests count drops back down below the MaxConnections limit.\nRecommended value = 20 - 100 depending on application response times\n\n*Best Practices: with MaxConnections=\"-1\" use LogLevel=\"Stats\" to monitor the pendingRequests numbers in the plug-in log, under normal conditions. Then, choose a value for MaxConnections that is significantly higher than the highest number shown in the log. This method will help you to determine a MaxConnections value that is right for your specific environment.\n\n\nConnectTimeout means \"how long should the plug-in wait when trying to open a socket to the Application Server\"? If there are streams already open and available to the Application Server, the plug-in will use one of those. However, sometimes the plug-in needs to open a new stream to the Application Server. That should not take very long, so the value for ConnectTimeout should be very small. A ConnectTimeout value of 0 means never time-out. In that case, the time-out is left up to the OS TCP layer, which is NOT ideal. It is much better to specify a small positive number (like 5 seconds).\nRecommended value = 5\n\n\nServerIOTimeout means \"how long should the plug-in wait for a response from the application\". After the socket is opened, the plug-in sends the request to the Application Server. The application processes the request and a response is sent back to the client, through the plug-in. How long should that take? What is reasonable, based on the application? There is no single correct answer here. It depends on the application. If the application is very quick to respond, then you can use a lower value for ServerIOTimeout. However, if the application requires more time to process the request (maybe to retrieve data from a database), then you should use a higher number for ServerIOTimeout. Using a value of 0 means that the plug-in will NOT time-out the request. This is often NOT ideal. A positive value means that the plug-in will NOT mark the appserver down after a ServerIOTimeout pops. So, if you want the plug-in to continue sending requests to the timed-out appserver, use a positive value. On the other hand, a negative value means that the plug-in WILL mark the appserver down after a ServerIOTimeout pops. So, if you want the plug-in to immediately mark the appserver down and fail-over to another appserver in the same cluster, use a negative value.\nRecommended value = -900 (that is negative 900)\n\nNote: The ability to use a negative ServerIOTimeout value was introduced in plug-in apar PK72097 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK72097].\n\n*Best Practices: use traces to determine the amount of time it takes for your application to respond to requests under normal conditions. Be sure to include the longest running requests that take the most time to respond. Then choose a value for ServerIOTimeout that is much larger (2X or 3X or more) than the longest response time. This method will ensure that your ServerIOTimeout is high enough to allow adequate time for the application to respond normally. Make it a negative value so that if the ServerIOTimeout pops, the plug-in will immediately mark the server down, and retry the request to a different appserver.\n\n\nServerIOTimeoutRetry can be used to decrease the number of retries after ServerIOTimeout has fired. By default, the Plug-in will try a request equal to the number of members in the cluster. For example, if the cluster has four members, and there is a ServerIOTimeout, the Plug-in will try it a second time. If the retry fails with ServerIOTimeout fired, then it will try a third time, and a fourth time if needed. But after four attempts, the Plug-in will give up and stop retrying. If you want to override this default behavior and reduce the number of retries after ServerIOTimeout, you can set ServerIOTimeoutRetry to a value that is less than the number of members in the cluster.\nRecommended value = -1 (this is the default)\n\nNote: This property was introduced by Plug-in apar PM70559 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM70559].\n\n\nRetryInterval is the time that the plug-in will wait before trying again to use an appserver that was marked down. The optimal value for RetryInterval depends on the number of appservers in the cluster, and the value used for ServerIOTimeout. You can use the following formula to determine the maximum RetryInterval value for your plug-in config:\n\n(number of appservers in cluster - 1) x (absolute ServerIOTimeout) - 1\n\nFor example, if there are two appservers in the cluster, and the value of ServerIOTimeout is -900, then the maximum RetryInterval setting would be:\n(2 - 1) x (900) - 1 = 899 seconds or less\n\nAnother example, if there are four appservers in the cluster, and the value of ServerIOTimeout is -900, then the maximum RetryInterval setting would be:\n(4 - 1) x (900) -1 = 2699 seconds or less\n\nWarning: Setting RetryInterval to a value higher than the recommended maximum, based on the formula above, can lead to an undesirable situation where all of the appservers in the cluster may be marked down simultaneously resulting in all requests temporarily failing.\nRecommended value = 60 (this is the default)\n\n\nAffinity requests are requests that contain a session cookie (ie. JSESSIONID). The session cookie is set by the Session Manager in WAS to ensure that all subsequent requests from the same client return to the same app server in the cluster. The session cookie contains the clone ID (or partition ID) of that specific app server. The web server Plug-in will look for the session cookie and use the clone ID to send the request to that specific WAS app server. An affinity request is not load balanced.\n\nIn the plug-in config there is a property called IgnoreAffinityRequests. This property determines if affinity requests will affect the load balance weights, or not. The default value for IgnoreAffinityRequests is True, which means that affinity requests will not have any affect on the load balance weights. This is best for environments where there are no, or few, affinity requests. On the other hand, for an environment with a lot of affinity requests, it may be better to set IgnoreAffinityRequests to False so that the load balance weights will accurately reflect the effect of having a lot of affinity requests.\n\n\nFail-over occurs when the plug-in marks a cluster member appserver (or clone) as \"down\", and then sends the pending requests to other members of the same cluster. This can happen if the plug-in is unable to open a new connection to the appserver within the ConnectTimeout. Or fail-over can happen if the plug-in has already sent the request to the appserver, but does not receive a response from the application within ServerIOTimeout. When the plug-in marks a cluster member appserver \"down\", it will handle the PENDING requests in one of two ways: Prior to plug-in apar PM12112 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM12112], the plug-in would send all of the pending requests to the very next appserver in the cluster. However, after plug-in apar PM12112 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM12112], the plug-in will randomly send the pending requests to any of the available appservers in the cluster. While the appserver is marked \"down\" the plug-in will no longer send any requests to it. After RetryInterval the plug-in will check to see if that appserver can be used successfully again. If so, the \"down\" flag will be removed and the appserver will be used again.\n\nNote: By default, the number of attempts to handle a request is limited by the number of appservers in the cluster. For example, if there are only two appservers in the cluster, and the request fails once, the plug-in will only attempt that request one more time (total of two attempts). Or another example, if there are five appservers in the same cluster, and the request fails once, then the plug-in will attempt to retry that same request up to four more times (total of five attempts). That number includes retries sent to the same appserver (session affinity), or attempts sent to different appservers (fail-over).\n\nUpdate: The plug-in apar PM70559 [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PM70559] introduced a new setting called \"ServerIOTimeoutRetry\" that can be used to control the number of retries due to ServerIOTimeout.\n\n\nIf Memory-to-Memory (M2M) session replication is enabled in WebSphere Application Server, then the GetDWLMTable setting in the plug-in config must be changed to \"true\". Memory-to-Memory replication uses partition IDs rather than clone IDs. This can lead to broken session affinity if GetDWLMTable is set to false (which is the default). So it is very important to set GetDWLMTable=\"true\" whenever using M2M in WebSphere Application Server.\nRecommendation = GetDWLMTable=\"true\" whenever M2M is used in WebSphere Application Server.\n\n\nEach web server child process loads a separate instance of the web server plug-in. And multiple running instances of the web server plug-in do not share information with each other. For example if the IBM HTTP Server web server is configured to start 3 child processes (StartServers 3), then there will be 3 instances of the web server plug-in running (one for each IBM HTTP Server child process). The dynamically changing LoadBalanceWeight of each cluster member is not shared between the plug-in instances. So, in one instance of the plug-in \"member1\" might be considered UP with a weight of 5, when in another instance of the plug-in \"member1\" might be considered DOWN and unusable. This can result in possibly different behaviors depending on which child process \/ plug-in instance handles each incoming request. For this reason it is recommended that you should configure the web server to use only a few web server child processes with many threads on each. See Tuning IBM HTTP Server to maximize the number of client connections to WebSphere Application Server [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21167658].\n\nIf you choose to use more than one web server child process, keep in mind that the plug-in settings are handled on a per instance basis. For example, MaxConnections means the number of pending requests that will be allowed on that server, for each plug-in instance. If MaxConnections = 20, and there are 3 web server child processes (3 plug-in instances), then each instance will allow 20 pending connections to that Application Server for a total of 60 pending connections.\n\n\nRelated information\n[http:\/\/g01zciwas003.ahe.pok.ibm.com\/support\/dcf\/preview.wss?host=g01zcidbs003.ahe.pok.ibm.com&db=support\/swg\/swgtech.nsf&unid=E3B7487DDFB64D2C852574C00071DA95&taxOC=SSCC2GP&MD=2011\/05\/11%2011:05:12&sid=#]Understanding plug-in Load Balancing [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21219567]\nUnderstanding plug-in Fail-over [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21219808]\nTuning IBM HTTP Server processes and threads [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21167658]\nweb server plug-in configuration [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21450051]\nModifying plug-in properties from the WebSphere Application Server administrative console [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21460889]\nHow do the properties ServerIOTimeout and PostBufferSize affect plug-in behavior?

The list of menu options will now include 'Library'.\n(6) Select the 'Library' menu option.\n(7) Open the 'Preferences' folder.\n(8) Rename the com.ibm.spss.plist object to old_com.ibm.spss.plist \n\n\n- Another option is to use the Terminal application and do the following:\nrm -fR ~\/Library\/Preferences\/com.ibm.spss.plist \n\n \n\nFinish and test your changes by doing the following: \n\n(9) Launch Statistics\n(10) Work with the program a bit.\n(11) Close the software (It should be quicker, do not force quit)\n(12) Re-launch Statistics\n(13) Work with the program a bit.\n(14) Close the software (do not force quit)\n(15) Launch the software \n\n\nNOTE: When you launch Statistics for the first time, it will take a little longer than subsequent launches, until you reboot your computer again. This is related to Java initialization routines. \n\n\n- FYI: Additionally, if you are using Mac OSX Mavericks 10.9.x, you need to stop the process that protects this file and restores it (it is deleted):\n\nSince OSX 10.9.x Mavericks a cached copy of your \"plist\" file is stored that uses a background process: CFPREFSD\nDeleting the \"plist\" file and restarting SPSS Statistics does not create a new copy of these files.\nRather, Mavericks restore its cached copy. \nOnly by stopping the \"cfprefsd\" process and starting SPSS Statistics, will it generate a new \"plist\" preference file and default toolbar.\n\nWhen you go to Finder - Applications - Utilities and open Activity Monitor on the 10.9.x computer you see that there is a CFPREFSD process visible for root user and for the current logged in user.\nYou need to stop the CFPREFSD process for the current user. Do so in the Terminal application by running the following command:\n\nkillall -u {CURRENT_USER} cfprefsd\n\nWhere {CURRENT_USER} is replaced with the person's user ID. One can get the user ID by typing \"whoami\" at a Terminal prompt. \n\nShould removing these files and running the program does not resolve the issue, you might need to remove all of them and reinstall the program.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n Need more help?

Mismatch code levels - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n Your WebSphere MQ (WMQ) batch job abends with an abend 102 - 00000000\nABEND102 ABENDS102 S102 \n\nCAUSE\nOne reason for Abend 102-00000000 - \n\nMismatch in code levels between WMQ MSTR (Queue Manager) and the batch job\n\nThe S102 is occurring as the batch job is running with V701 libraries (for example, SCSQAUTH dataset which contains CSQBSRV, CSQBCON etc) against a V710 queue manager. In order to run against a V710 queue manager the V710 libraries need to be used by the batch job. \nIn order to connect to a V710 queue manager the application needs to run with a V710 SCSQAUTH. The V710 SCSQAUTH will allow an application to connect to both a V710 or a V701 queue manager. \nThis is documented in the Information Center (section 'z\/OS: Planning for migration from WebSphere MQ version 7.0.1 to WebSphere MQ version 7. [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r1\/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.doc%2Fmi77108_.htm]1'; \n\n\n * \n\n\nPer ' Application migration and interoperation [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r1\/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.mq.doc%2Fmi23001_.htm]' topic, WebSphere MQ does not support connecting server applications loading libraries from the earlier level to connect to a later level of queue manager. On z\/OS the STEPLIB must reference the target libraries for the queue manager. \n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nIn IPCS you can view level of CSQBSRV in the batch job address space. \n\nSTORAGE ---------------------------------- \nCommand ===> \nAddress: \n294D8210 DD2DD220 DD0CB6C7 D70BDAF8 DAF8D77B | ..K....GP..8.8P# | \n294D8220 D748D748 A7F4000E C3E2D8C2 E2D9E540 | P.P.x4..CSQBSRV \n294D8230 F2F0F1F2 F1F1F2F7 E4D2F8F3 F7F7F440 | 20121127UK83774| . \nPTF UK83774is for Release ... 010 (V7.0.1) \n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nCorrect the STEPLIB for the batch job to point to the V7.1.0 libraries.\n\n\n\nHISTORICAL NUMBER\n 04659 79L 000\n47552 077 724 \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS\/SYNONYM\n wmq mq",

    "reference_doc": "IBM Application running on a DB2 client performs poorly due to low level semget calls issued by DB2 - United States\n\ndb2trc alloc; semget TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n This document provides troubleshooting information for the situation where an application running on a remote DB2 client performs poorly. In particular, it describes a scenario where performance is poor because of failed semget() calls to the operating system.\n\n\nCAUSE\nDB2® Universal Database™ (DB2 UDB) has an internal trace facility called \"db2trc\". This trace facility acquires Inter Process Communication (IPC) resources (both semaphore and shared memory). Even though a DB2 trace is not turned on, it may issue semget() calls to the operating system. These calls will fail, though, since no IPC resources were acquired.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe trace facility has an \"alloc\" option that can allocate necessary IPC resources. When you issue db2start, internal functions equivalent to command db2trc alloc are automatically issued, and when you issue db2stop, the trace segment will be removed if no one is using it.\n\nSince a DB2 client does not necessarily have the ability to perform the db2start command, no IPC's will be automatically allocated for the trace facility, and hence the problem.\n\nThe solution is to issue the following command at the DB2 client:\n\ndb2trc alloc\n\nThis will then create the necessary IPC resources, and prevent the semget() calls from failing (since the semget() call now has IPC resources that it can use). The potential performance problem will thus be avoided.\n\nThe failed semget() operations are more of a concern for Solaris Operating Environment, Linux®, HP-UX and AIX® operating systems, in terms of performance implications. Windows® will not have this problem due to its specific architecture.\n\nThe db2trc alloc command should be invoked every time the client is restarted, and therefore it is recommended to add this command to a startup script.\n\nNote: To determine if the application is issuing semget() calls, the best course of action would be to take a \"truss\". Please read your operating system manuals on how to perform and read a truss.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n IC85712 (AIX) [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?crawler=1&uid=swg1IC85712]\nFP5: db2trc command has been improved for clients (Linu [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/db2luw\/v9r7\/topic\/com.ibm.db2.luw.wn.doc\/doc\/c0059466.html]\nv10.5 IT17501 [https:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IT17501]\nv11.1 IT17518 [https:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IT17518]",

    "reference_doc": "IBM Business Process Manager users receive errors that session has expired - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n If you are using CA Wily Introscope to monitor performance in the same environment with IBM Business Process Manager, you might receive messages that a user session has expired. Before you can continue working on IBM BPM, you must log out and log in again. \n\nCAUSE\nWebSphere Application Server has session security integration enabled by default. Enabling this feature guards against the possibility of session data being hijacked by another user. \nThe Wily Introscope agent might try to access an active user session to monitoring purposes. Because Wily does not have the same authenticated user, the session security integration feature prevents Wily from accessing that user session. \n\nBy having a custom property named InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException set to true, the session manager will invalidate the active user session. This causes the \"session expired\" messages for the IBM BPM user. (The default value for InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException is false.)\n\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nTo verify you have this problem, you can turn on tracing for the Web container, the session, security, and IBM BPM using these tracing strings: \n\n\n*=info:com.ibm.ws.webcontainer*=all:com.ibm.wsspi.webcontainer*=all:HTTPChannel=all:GenericBNF=all:com.ibm.ws.session.*=all:com.ibm.ws.security.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.security.*=all:com.ibm.websphere.wim.*=all:com.ibm.wsspi.wim.*=all:com.ibm.ws.wim.*=all:WLE.*=all \n\nYou might see entries in the stack trace similar to the following lines:\n\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.servlethelper.ServletRequestHelper.getSession(ServletRequestHelper.java:286)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.servlethelper.ServletRequestHelper.get(ServletRequestHelper.java:513)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.trace.hc2.HttpServletLazyMapProvider.get(HttpServletLazyMapProvider.java:63)\nat com.wily.util.adt.LazyMap.get(LazyMap.java:182)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.trace.hc2.HttpServletLazyMap.putAllParameters(HttpServletLazyMap.java:191)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.trace.hc2.HttpServletTracer.IInvocationDataParameterCallback_addParameters(HttpServletTracer.java:782)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.trace.InvocationData.addParameterCallbacks(InvocationData.java:3486)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.VirtualStackFeatureHelper.fillComponentParams(VirtualStackFeatureHelper.java:157)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.VirtualStackFeatureHelper.getTransanctionSnapShotFromInvocationData(VirtualStackFeatureHelper.java:235)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.VirtualStackFeatureHelper.getTransactionSnapshotFromStack(VirtualStackFeatureHelper.java:75)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.StallFeatureBase.reportStall(StallFeatureBase.java:50)\nat com.wily.introscope.agent.feature.StallCheckBehaviorCorrect.ITimestampedRunnable_execute(StallCheckBehaviorCorrect.java:61)\nat com.wily.util.heartbeat.IntervalHeartbeat$BehaviorNode.execute(IntervalHeartbeat.java:972)\nat com.wily.util.heartbeat.IntervalHeartbeat.executeNextBehaviorAndCalculateSleepTime(IntervalHeartbeat.java:491)\nat com.wily.util.heartbeat.IntervalHeartbeat.access$2(IntervalHeartbeat.java:445)\nat com.wily.util.heartbeat.IntervalHeartbeat$HeartbeatRunnable.run(IntervalHeartbeat.java:668)\nat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:784)\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo prevent the sessions from expiring, choose one of the following options: \n\n * Stop the Wily agent. \n * Remove the custom property InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException=true by completing the following steps: 1. Log in to the administrative console. \n   \n   2. Click server_name > Session Manager > Custom properties. \n   \n   3. Select the InvalidateOnUnauthorizedSessionRequestException property, which is set to true, and delete it.\n   The purpose of this setting in BPM default configuration is to \"gracefully\" terminate existing sessions and create new sessions in shared browser scenarios. With this setting removed, you may see temporary exceptions in cases two users share the same browser instance and try to switch identity without closing the browser in between. \n   \n   4. Click Apply and then save the master configuration. \n   \n   5. Restart the servers. \n   \n   \n * Disable specific Wily configurations that reuse the session IDs from existing users.\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n CA Technologies: Session killed by agent heartbeat [http:\/\/www.ca.com\/us\/support\/ca-support-online\/product-content\/knowledgebase-articles\/tec1314663.aspx]\n\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Standard AIX, Linux, Solaris, Windows 8.5.7.CF201706, 8.5.7.CF201703, 8.5.7.CF201612, 8.5.7.CF201609, 8.5.7.CF201606, 8.5.7, 8.5.6.2, 8.5.6.1, 8.5.6, 8.5.5, 8.5.0.2, 8.5.0.1, 8.5, 8.0.1.3, 8.0.1.2, 8.0.1.1, 8.0.1, 8.0 Business Integration IBM Business Process Manager Express Linux, Windows 8.5.7.CF201706, 8.5.7.CF201703, 8.5.7.CF201612, 8.5.7.CF201609, 8.5.7.CF201606, 8.5.7, 8.5.6.2, 8.5.6.1, 8.5.6, 8.5.5, 8.5.0.2, 8.5.0.1, 8.5, 8.0.1.3, 8.0.1.2, 8.0.1.1, 8.0.1, 8.0 \nPRODUCT ALIAS\/SYNONYM\n BPM",

If quotation marks are not used, the object is processed with a name in upper-case. \n\nWhen specifying the SET command with the following value CLNTUSER(testuser) the string 'testuser' will be folded to upper-case resulting in the following value being actually used by runmqsc:\nCLNTUSER(TESTUSER)\nAnd in this case, there is no record for the user TESTUSER (the record is for 'testuser').\n\n\nANSWER\nNOTICE that the userid mentioned in the CLNTUSER field of the output of the DISPLAY CHLAUTH command is NOT surrounded by single quotes. \n\nHowever, you MUST include the single quotes when specifying the value during an ACTION(REMOVE):\n\nSET CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\n1 : set CHLAUTH(*) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('testuser') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\n\n++ Example of record with more attributes\n\nLet's examine the case when a record has more attributes, such as:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(ADD)\nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\ndisplay CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\n9 : display CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL)\nAMQ8878: Display channel authentication record details.\nCHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP)\nDESCR( ) CUSTOM( )\nADDRESS(*) CLNTUSER(client_1)\nMCAUSER(user_1) USERSRC(MAP)\n\nYou want to delete the record and you try the following command which is based on the command that worked well for a simpler case. But this time, it fails:\n\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8884: Channel authentication record not found.\n\nYou try the original command that created the record, but changing the action to REMOVE:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('client_1') USERSRC(MAP) MCAUSER('user_1') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE)\nAMQ8885: Parameter not allowed for this action on a channel authentication record.\n\nThe attribute USERSRC is not a valid parameter for the REMOVE action (see table below).\nTherefore, by removing this attribute, then the following command worked successfully to remove the record:\nSET CHLAUTH(MY.CHANNEL) TYPE(USERMAP) CLNTUSER('mengano') ADDRESS('*') ACTION(REMOVE) \nAMQ8877: WebSphere MQ channel authentication record set.\n\nSee:\nWebSphere MQ 8.0.0 > IBM MQ > Reference > Administration reference > MQSC reference > The MQSC commands > \nSET CHLAUTH [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSFKSJ_8.0.0\/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc\/q086630_.htm]\n.\n+ begin excerpt\n.\nUsage notes\nThe following table shows which parameters are valid for each value of ACTION:\n.\nAction \nParameter ADD or REMOVE REMOVEALL\nREPLACE\nCHLAUTH X X X \nTYPE X X X \nCMDSCOPE X X X \nACTION X X X \nADDRESS X X\nADDRLIST X X \nCHCKCLNT X \nCLNTUSER X X \nMCAUSER X \nQMNAME X X \nSSLCERTI X X \nSSLPEER X X \nUSERLIST X X \nUSERSRC X \nWARN X \nDESCR X \n.\n+ end excerpt\n\n\nAdditional Search Words: uppercase lowercase upper lower case\n\n \n\nPRODUCT ALIAS\/SYNONYM\n WMQ MQ MQSeries",

    "reference_doc": "IBM Optimizing barcode recognition with IBM Datacap - United States\n\nbar code barcode recognition optimization patch code patchcode TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n What can be done to give the best results with barcode recognition? \n\nCAUSE\nDuring printing, the ink can bleed or spread out over the white area, and then, during scanning, additional spreading of black may occur. As a result, the white spaces end up disappearing and the bars blend into each other. This can be seen by looking at the scanned image at high magnification. The barcode must meet the specifications after accounting for this.\n\nANSWER\nTo optimize barcode recognition: \n\n * The width of the thinnest bar (called the X-dimension) must be at least one pixel, and two pixels are recommended for best results. At 200 DPI this means each bar must be at least .01 inch. Generally this translates to about 4 to 5 characters per inch. \n * The X-dimension or width of the narrowest black bar and white space between bars must be at least 20 mils (1\/50 inch, 1\/2 mm). When scanned perfectly at 200 DPI this would result in 4 pixels, and at 300 DPI 6 pixels. \n * For Code 39 symbols: a 20 mil X-dimension results in a density of approximately 3.6 characters per inch. Optimally the height should be at least 1\/4 inch or 15% of the width, whichever is greater, though this is not an absolute requirement. The minimum quiet zone (white space before and after the bar code) specified by the standard is 1\/5 inch. \n * Scanning can sometimes introduce white or black stripes on the image running in the scanning direction, typically vertical stripes if the paper is scanned in Portrait orientation. Bar codes printed in normal horizontal orientation cannot be read reliably when this occurs. It is advisable to print barcodes perpendicular to the direction of scanning. If the barcode must be printed horizontally on a page, scanning in landscape orientation will make the barcode more robust in the presence of common scanner issues. \n * By default, Datacap only accepts barcode images with 71% confidence or higher. To modify it to accept low confidence barcodes also, add the following action to run prior to barcode detection:  * SetMinimumConfidenceBP(1) - This is equivalent to 11% confidence. Each increment increases the required confidence 10% and higher values can be used if false barcodes are detected. A value of 4 is usually sufficient for this purpose.\n   \n   \n * Barcode recognition has an internal barcode enhancement capability. To maintain high performance, this feature is turned off by default. If low quality barcodes are being received, it may be desired to turn on barcode enhancement, despite the performance hit. To do this, add the following action to run prior to barcode detection:  * rrSet(1,@P.bp_enhance)\n   \n   \n * Performing Datacap's regular image enhancement (ImageFix) prior to running any barcode recognition action is not recommended. ImageFix is designed to optimize text recognition and can actually degrade the barcode. There are some rare exceptions, and if it is necessary to use image enhancement prior to barcode recognition, pay close attention to the configuration settings, especially vertical line removal and despeckle. To ensure image processing is not interfering with barcode recognition, test with the ImageFix() action removed.\n\n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Enterprise Content Management Datacap Taskmaster Capture Not Applicable 8.1.0",

Review this topic to learn how to enable the feature if your queries could benefit from it. \n\nCAUSE\nStarting with the June 2015 fix packs for NPS 7.1.0.6 and 7.2.0.5, and the NPS 7.2.1 release, the snippet results cache is disabled by default because it was optimized for specific workloads. Starting in the March fix packs 7.1.0.9, 7.2.0.8, and 7.2.1.2, the feature is enabled by default because it is optimized for most workloads. \n\nENVIRONMENT\nNetezza Platform Software releases 7.1.0.6 through 7.1.0.8-P1, 7.2.0.5 through 7.2.0.7-P1 and 7.2.1 through 7.2.1.1-P1\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nQueries that take advantage of the snippet results cache have longer runtimes after upgrades from any 7.x release to a release listed in the Environment section.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe snippet results cache is a query optimization feature added in NPS release 7.1 that can help to improve the performance of small queries. The feature was enabled by default for the NPS 7.1 releases up to 7.1.0.6 and for 7.2 releases up to 7.2.0.5.\n\n\nThe snippet results cache saves the intermediate results of snippets and can reuse them rather than incur the processing time to recompute them when needed. The cache can help to improve the performance of small queries. \n\nHowever, in environments where queries run against tables that constantly change with TRUNCATE, load, updates, and\/or rollback operations, caching may not be a good match if cached snippet results are frequently invalidated before they can be reused. \n\nIf you upgrade from any 7.x release to a release listed in the Environment section and detect a change in query performance for queries that take advantage of the snippet results cache, you can re-enable the feature.\n\nTo enable the feature on a session level and test the snippet results cache behavior, you must pause the NPS system, set the variable, and resume the system, as follows: \n\nnzsystem pause -force\nnzsystem set -arg system.srcMode=1 -force\nnzsystem resume\n\nThis setting remains in effect until the database is restarted. You can add the definition to the system.cfg file to keep the setting in effect after the Netezza software restarts:\n\n\n 1. Log in to the Netezza system as the nz user account.\n    \n 2. With any text editor, open the \/nz\/data\/config\/system.cfg file. \n    \n 3. Look for a system.srcMode definition in the file to make sure that one is not already present and\/or commented out. If you find an entry, make sure that system.srcMode=1 is set and not commented out with a # character. If you cannot find an entry, add system.srcMode=1 to the file. \n    \n 4. Save and close the system.cfg file.\n    \n 5. Stop and restart the NPS software using the nzstop and then the nzstart commands.",

This step-by-step technote guides DataPower Appliance users on how to configure DataPower MQ Manager Object to use SSL in mutual authentication mode. This technote assumes that MQ queue manager is configured with key database and its associted password file for using SSL connection with other MQ clients. If it is not configured yet, it has to be done first using the URL: http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r0\/topic\/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc\/e_ssl.htm [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r0\/topic\/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc\/e_ssl.htm] \n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nIn order to use this technote, you should have a working knowledge of how to setup and administer MQ Server in Windows, AIX, Solaris, HP-UX, or Linux environment. You should also have an understanding of how to configure DataPower MQ Manager Object that connects to remote WebSphere MQ Queue Manager (qmgr). This technote focuses on configuring DataPower MQ Client to use SSL in mutual authentication mode with Firmware Releases 3.8.2 and later fixpacks. Follow these steps to configure DataPower MQ Manager Object (mq-qm object) to access WebSphere MQ Queue Manager (Remote MQ Server) in SSL mutual authentication mode.\nWebSphere MQ configuration prerequisites\n\nThe following three steps are necessary to make sure that the SSL configurations for the Remote MQ Server is correctly working. Refer to IBM WebSphere MQ product manuals to configure MQ environment to work in SSL mutual authentication mode.\n\n\n 1. Configure WebSphere MQ Queue Manager (Remote MQ Server) to use SSL authentication (SSLCAUTH as \"required\") using URL: http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r0\/topic\/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc\/e_ssl.htm [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r0\/topic\/com.ibm.mq.explorer.doc\/e_ssl.htm]. \n 2. Configure WebSphere MQ Client to use SSL authentication. \n 3. Verify that WebSphere MQ Client can PUT\/GET message(s) using application programs such as amqsputc and amqsgetc with MQ Queue Manager in SSL mutual authentication mode.\n    \n\n\nGenerate self signed key\/certificate \n 1. Generate the self signed key\/certificate pair using the \"crypto tool\" from the DataPower device. \n 2.  Download the two files to your local machine. For the sake of illustration purpose, the names of the key and certificate files are defined as \"dpmqclient-privkey.pem\" and \"dpmqclient-sscert.pem\" respectively. \n 3. Assuming that openssl tool (www.openssl.org [http:\/\/www.openssl.org]) is installed in the local machine. With openssl tool, you can use the following command to create a \"pkcs12\" type key from the above key\/certificate pair which are of PEM type. This step is necessary as MQ key database will not import key\/certificate files created as PEM.\n    \n    openssl pkcs12 -export -out dpmqclient-key.p12-in dpmqclient-sscert.pem-inkey dpmqclient-privkey.pem-name ibmwebspheremqadmin\n    \n    Note the value associated with \"-name\" parameter. IBM WebSphereMQ client required a friendly label as \"ibmwebspheremq<userid>\" of the MQ client user. In this example, the user name is being used as \"admin\". This user must be used in the DataPower MQ Queue Manager object and it must also be an authorized user for both the DataPower MQ instance as well as for the remote WebSphere MQ Server. Please refer to Pages G58-62 in the 3.6.0-WebGui Guide for various fields as described in MQ Queue Manager configuration screen. Also note the following two fields with appropriate values which are required for the MQ Queue Manager object to connect the remote WebSphere MQ Server in SSL mode. \n\n *  SSL Key Repository: The key database file name \n   SSL Cipher Specification: TRIPLE_DES_SHA_US \n   \n\nTo import a personal certificate using \"iKeycmd\" GUI, use the following commands in your host machine where the WebSphere MQ Server\/Client is running. \n * UNIX\n * \n * \n *  gsk7cmd -cert -import -file filename -pw password -type pkcs12 -target filename -target_pw password -target_type cms \n * \n * \n * Windows\n * \n * \n *  runmqckm -cert -import -file filename -pw password -type pkcs12 -target filename -target_pw password -target_type cms \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * -file \n * filenam \n * \n * \n * -pw \n * password\n * \n * \n * -type \n * pkcs12 \n * \n * \n * -target \n * filename\n * \n * \n * -target_pw \n * password\n * \n * \n * -target_type \n * cms\n * \n\n\n\nGenerate the new password file \n\nFollow these steps to generate the new password file. \n 1.  Start the iKeyman GUI using either the gsk7ikm command (on UNIX) or the strmqikm command (on Windows). \n 2.  From the Key Database File menu, click Open. The Open window displays. \n 3.  Click Key database type and select CMS (Certificate Management System). \n 4.  Click Browse to navigate to the directory that contains the key database files. \n 5.  Select the key database file in which you want to save the certificate, for example key.kdb. \n 6.  Click Open. The Password Prompt window displays. \n 7.  Type the password you set when you created the key database and click OK. \n 8.  The name of your key database file displays in the File Name field. The Personal Certificates menu will display both \"ibmwebspheremq<qmgr>\" and \"ibmwebspheremq<user>\" labels. \n 9.  In the WebSphere MQ Certificate key database, there is one certificate assigned to the queue manager or client. The certificate's Friendly Name attribute contains the string ibmwebspheremq followed in lower case by the queue manager name or the client logon ID. This Friendly Name value becomes the label of the certificate in the GSKit key database. Refer to Alter the Friendly Name (Label) of pkcs12 certificates for importing into GSKit [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21225160] if you want to alter the Friendly Name (Label) of pkcs12 certificates that are part of WebSphere MQ Certificate key database. Refer to \"Migrating SSL Security Certificates in WebSphere MQ for Windows\" [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r0\/topic\/com.ibm.mq.csqzas.doc\/sy12430_.htm?resultof=%22%6d%71%22%20%22%66%69%78%22%20%22%6d%69%67%72%61%74%65%64%22%20%22%6d%69%67%72%61%74%22%20%22%63%65%72%74%69%66%69%63%61%74%65%73%22%20%22%63%65%72%74%69%66%22%20] if you want to fix the migrated certificates from the WebSphere MQ V5.3 version to later version. [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wmqv7\/v7r0\/index.jsp?topic=\/com.ibm.mq.csqzao.doc\/mi10240_.htm] \n 10. From the key database File menu, click Stash Password. This will create the new password file as \"key.sth\". Select OK and close the key database File. \n 11. Upload the \"key.kdb\" and \"key.sth\" files to \"cert:\" directory of the DataPower box. Configure the MQ client object in the DataPower box to use this key database as shown in the screen shot above to connect in SSL mutual authentication mode with the MQ Manager. The following screen shot shows the \"key.kdb\" and \"key.sth\" files are located in the \"cert:\" directory of the application domain.[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21260155&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21260155&aid=1] This screen shot below shows that mq-qm object is using the \"key.kdb\" file located in the \"cert:\" directory with the associated cipher specification as \"TRIPLE_DES_SHA_US\". Note that SSL Proxy Profile field is \"(none)\" as this configuration is using key repository method for SSL connection.[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21260155&aid=2] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21260155&aid=2] \n 12. Refresh the SSL security attribute of the MQ Manager to use this key database and password files from the host machine running MQ Server.\n     \n     Runmqsc <MQ Manager>\n     Refresh security type(ssl)\n     End\n     \n 13. Test your application to PUT\/GET MQ message(s) using DataPower MQ client with the new configuration.\n\nNote: DataPower 3.8 and later firmware provides a separate method for the mq-qm object to use SSL in mutual authentication mode. This method uses DataPower SSL Proxy Profile that includes Crypto profile with Identification Credential.

    "ground_truth": "1. Support the export of private keys using the crypto-export command.\n   HSM-enabled DataPower appliances provide the capability to export private keys by utilizing the crypto-export command.",
    "reference_doc": "IBM How to export and import keys from an HSM-enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do I export and import private keys between the same or different Hardware Security Module (HSM) enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance? \n\nANSWER\nHSM-enabled DataPower appliances support the export of private keys using the crypto-export command. For key export to work, various conditions must be met: \n\n * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines \n * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen's exportable option) \n * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.\n\n\nEach HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don't need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :- \n\nFirst, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization). \n\nSecond, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command's exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable. \n\nFinally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance. Each time the command is run, it will need the output file from the previous step (as the input to the current step) which must be moved manually (usually with the copy command). \n\nOnce all of this has been done, then private keys may move from system to system with crypto-export and crypto-import. \n\nNote that the non-HSM appliance can export keys immediately at keygen time, but never at a later time. \n\nFor additional information refer to the online Info Center [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wsdatap\/v3r8m2\/index.jsp?topic=%2Fxi50%2Fwelcome.htm] and search for \"PIN entry device\".\n\nNote: You will need to sign into the documentation portal with your IBM Registration ID and password.",

Both are included as downloadable tools from within IBM Support Assistant Workbench [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/support\/isa\/]. \n\n\n\n\nLocating the Core Dump \n\nFor WebSphere Application Server installations, the default location for the core dumps is in the profile's root directory: <WAS_HOME>\/profiles\/<PROFILE_NAME>\/ \n\nThe file extension will usually be *.dmp, but on some versions of AIX and Linux, the file may simply be named core. The process id and the date stamp are normally appended to the name of the file. \n\n\n\n\nProcessing the Dump \n\nExecute the jextract command on the same system and installation of WebSphere Application Server that the core dump was produced on. If you don't use the full path on AIX or Linux, make sure to use .\/jextract (including the dot-slash) so the correct executable is picked up. \n\nReplace [COREDUMP_PATH] with the full path plus filename of the core dump produced. \n\n \n\nIf you do not know if compressed references is enabled, scroll to the FAQ section for a brief explanation. \n\n \n\nDetermining the Java Directory \n\nBecause different profiles on WebSphere Application Server 8.5.5.X and later can use different SDKs, the java directory inside the installation folder can differ. To determine the path, check the process list for the application server process and see which folder the java executable is being launched from. \n\n \n\nNOTE: If you are on WebSphere Liberty and are using an IBM SDK, the entire path to that SDK will differ. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n32-bit JVM and\n64-bit JVM with Compressed References disabled\nAIX\/Linux: \n<WAS_HOME>\/<JAVA_DIR>\/jre\/bin\/jextract [COREDUMP_PATH]\n\nWindows: \n<WAS_HOME>\\<JAVA_DIR>\\jre\\bin\\jextract.exe [COREDUMP_PATH]\n\n\n\n\n64-bit JVM with Compressed References enabled\nDoes not apply to WebSphere Application Server 6.1\nAIX\/Linux: \n<WAS_HOME>\/<JAVA_DIR>\/jre\/bin\/jextract -J-Xcompressedrefs [COREDUMP_PATH]\n\nWindows: \n<WAS_HOME>\\<JAVA_DIR>\\jre\\bin\\jextract.exe -J-Xcompressedrefs [COREDUMP_PATH] \n\n \n\n\n\n\nMax Heap Size \n\nTo adjust the max heap size, you can add -J-Xmx to adjust the size. For example, -J-Xmx1024m allows for a max heap size of 1024 MB when jextract is run. \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFiles Generated \n\nThe output will determine where the compressed data is stored (usually a .zip extension, .sdff is seen on older environments). Check the location of the core dump as that will be the most common location. \n\nCore files are usually compressible since a lot of data is zero; 10x compression can be expected in the resulting zip file \n\n \n\nIf you find XML files in the output directory, this may mean jextract failed, as these files are supposed to be placed automatically within the SDFF or ZIP file. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nError Messages \n\nEyeCatcher Error\nUnable to find J9VMRAS eyecatcher\nError. Internal failure detected during jextract \n\nThis error message indicates that jextract failed to identify the dump. This could be due to a number of things, including \n\n* The dump was not produced by WebSphere Application Server\n* The dump was produced from a native library or component such as a JNI component or database driver.\n* (AIX only) The dump generated is in an incompatible dump format due to an AIX OS issue (see APAR IZ88097 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1IZ88097] for more details). \n\n \n\nOut of Memory Error \n\nSometimes the core dump is much larger than the default heap size can manage, and the recommendation is to increase the heap size using the -J-Xmx option. \n\n \n\n\n\n\nFAQ \n\nHow do I determine if compressed references is enabled? \n\nCompressed references were first introduced in 64-bit builds of IBM SDK 6.0. If WebSphere Application Server is at version 7.0.0.3 or higher, it will be enabled by default; see APAR PK75174 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg1PK75174]. \n\nChecking the JVM arguments in the admin console can verify if compressed references was enabled manually. However, it's best to check the ps output or the javacore for the argument -Xcompressedrefs \n\nIf you find the argument -Xnocompressedrefs has been added, this means it's disabled (see page 7 of this document [ftp:\/\/public.dhe.ibm.com\/software\/webserver\/appserv\/was\/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for more info)) \n\n \n\nWhat happens to jextract if I cannot determine if compressed references was enabled? \n\nIf you run jextract and did not realize compressed references was enabled, the output will ask you to rerun jextract and add the following argument: -J-Xcompressedrefs \n\n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n MustGather: Crash on AIX [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21055387]\nMustGather: Crash on Linux [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21104706]\nMustGather: Crash on Windows [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21053924]\nGenerating Userdumps on Windows [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21138203]\nCrash on AIX produces no core or a truncated core [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21052642]\nCrash on Linux produces no core or a truncated core [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21115658]",

    "reference_doc": "IBM Obtaining debug information during Decision Warehouse trace capture - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How can I obtain debug information when the trace is saved to the Decision Warehouse ? \n\nCAUSE\nTo minimize the impact of Decision Warehouse (DW) monitoring on the processing of ruleset executions, possible failures to save the trace to the database may remain silent (no stack trace in the logs of the application server). \n\nANSWER\nIf an issue arises during DW trace persistence at runtime, the related messages and stack traces are only available programmatically through the following API: ilog.rules.res.session.IlrSessionResponse.getWarnings() \n\nSo it is possible for an error to remain silent if the warnings above are not explicitly logged by the application. \n\nIt is however possible to customize the DW trace and log additional debug information even when the application does not explicitly log the above mentioned warnings. The attached sample uses the java.util.logging API to append to the ilog.rules.support.debugtrace.DebugTraceDAO logger the following: \n\n * at SEVERE level any exception that occurred while attempting to persist the trace to the database \n * at INFO level a summary of the trace with ruleset path information and a list of execution events \n * at FINEST level the list of session response warnings and the full execution trace XML (beware this can be a very large amount of information going to the log, possibly several megabytes)\n\n\nBy default only INFO level and above messages (including SEVERE) are typically visible in the application server logs. So the first two set of information above should be visible, while the FINEST level should require specific configuration of the Java logging to be visible. \n\nInstructions \n\nBundle the attached jrules-debugtrace.jar sample in the Rule Execution Server (RES) application that is performing ruleset executions:  * If you are using JRules Hosted Transparent Decision Service (HTDS), in jrules-res-htds-<appserver>.ear\/jrules-res-htds-<appserver>.war\/WEB-INF\/lib \n * If you are using JRules Scenario Service Provider (SSP) in jrules-ssp-<appserver>.ear\/jrules-ssp-server.war\/WEB-INF\/lib \n * If you are executing rules from your application, the sample should be packaged alongside the RES session library that your application already bundles \n\n\n\njrules-debugtrace.jar [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21433278&aid=2]jrules-debugtrace.jar [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21433278&aid=1] \nIf you are interested in learning about the implementation of this DW trace you can use the following eclipse project : \n\njrules-debugtrace-src.zip [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21433278&aid=4]jrules-debugtrace-src.zip [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21433278&aid=3] \nRELATED INFORMATION\n#A simplified Chinese translation is available [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21665639]\n\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration IBM Operational Decision Manager Platform Independent 8.5, 8.0.1, 8.0, 7.5 Enterprise",

For example: \n\n * The first user accessing a RTS \/ DC server that remained idle overnight experiences a failure upon logging and the server log shows an com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException occurred at that time. \n * After a RES server has been processing execution requests normally for some time, an attempt to deploy a ruleset update fails and the server log shows an com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException occurred upon an attempt to invalidate a ruleset or to retrieve its definition.\n\n\nCAUSE\nThe underlying network connection for a data source is no longer valid although the data source itself remains considered active from the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool management perspective. An attempt by a JRules module to try and access its data base through one such data source connection provided by the Application Server may then fail. \nThe network connection of a data source may become invalid for a number of reasons, one typical example is that a firewall between the Application Server and the Database has a policy to discard network connections that remain idle for some time.\n\n\nENVIRONMENT\nThe exception com.ibm.websphere.ce.cm.StaleConnectionException is specific to WebSphere Application Server environments. But a similar issue can be experienced with Weblogic, see: Rule Execution Server on WebLogic unable to load ruleset after period of inactivity [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21615801]\n\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure the WebSphere Application Server data source connection pool [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wasinfo\/v7r0\/index.jsp?topic=\/com.ibm.websphere.nd.multiplatform.doc\/info\/ae\/ae\/udat_conpoolset.html] so as to eliminate occurrences of StaleConnectionException : \n\n * Set the Minimum connections to 0 to avoid situations where a connection is kept in the pool to meet the minimum requirement, even though it may have been idle for longer than Unused timeout \n * Set the values for Unused timeout and Reap timeout so that the sum does not exceed any network level idle connection timeout\n\n\nThe document Troubleshooting stale connection problems [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21247168#SCETroubleshooting] provides further information.

    "ground_truth": "1. Configure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events.\n   ",
    "reference_doc": "IBM DataPower off-device logging: a configuration example - United States\n\ndatapower; 7993; machine type 7993; logging; off device; off device logging; log target; off-device; syslog; debug log level; debug; log level TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n This technote gives an example of how to enable off-device logging on an IBM® WebSphere® DataPower® appliance. This can be very helpful when a debug log level is needed to help isolate a problem or monitor behavior over a long period of time or can be used in production environment as DataPower only keeps a limited number of log files (the default is 3 files) in the file system in a rotational basis. \n\nCAUSE\nThe DataPower device has a finite amount of space to hold larger than average log files or long term logging needs in production environment. \n\nIt should be noted that if used while debugging at load or in a capacity issue, log events may be dropped. There is a prioritization of events within the device and client traffic always comes first. Log events dropped can be confirmed or counted from the Status>Log Targets menu in the WebGUI.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nConfigure a server daemon to listen and capture the DataPower devices events. First, this example shows how to create the log target sending events to a syslog destination. The other examples listed below will have their own strong points to be considered depending on the problem scenario. \n\n \n\nSyslog: \n\n* The syslog protocol operates over UDP which has no guarantee on packet delivery - a fast fire and forget method. \n\nTo create the new log target, go into the default domain: Objects > Log Targets \n\nConfigure the log target with settings as follows from the WebGUI: \n\n 1. Name the log target \n 2. Select Target Type of syslog \n 3. Fill in the Local Identifier with a descriptive string that may be used by a remote recipient to identify this specific log target \n 4. Enter the Remote Host Address and the Remote IP Port as in the screen shot wherex.x.x.x is the IP address of the remote syslog server that listens on port 514 \n 5. Take all other defaults\n\n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=1]  \n\n \n\nUnder the Event Subscriptions tab, you can select all and debug as indicated here: \n\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=2] \n\n * \n * 6. Generate log events in the DataPower by using some transactions, for example by saving the configuration from the WebGUI or running some test load into a domain.\n\n\nSyslog-ng, will simply work over the TCP protocol to ensure the packet is delivered to the destination. The same consideration should be applied to a device under high load in that a log event could be dropped if not able to be wrote out to the network within time. \n\n \n\nNFS:\nAll NFS limitations apply from file size and permission settings. This is a more common approach using an NFS static mount to capture a log target and can allow for slightly more reliable messages to be logged. The limiting factor again is the speed of the network and NFS server response time. \n\n \n\nFile type: \n\nUsing a file type log target with a backup method as seen here:\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=3]\nThis will allow log events to quickly be written to a local file on the device's file system. Once the file reaches its set size a connection to the destination will upload the file from the device. This will upload with a unique time and date stamp on the uploaded file.\n\nThis is a useful method to capture sporadic problems. This is also useful for long running transactions that may span more than one file depending on device load.\n\n\nHTTP service:\nFinally a clever method that may be used in some senarios would be an HTTP service on the device.\nUsing an HTTP service configured in the following way,\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21269136&aid=4] \n\nOnce the file type log is created in the logtemp:\/\/\/ directory, a client browser or wget type client can easily retrieve the file from the device. \n\nThis is very useful when there is no local or accessible remote log storage location to the device, due to firewall or network restrictions. \n\nThis is also removing the limitation of the device dropping the log event should it not be able to write the log event to the network. \n\nEach of the above methods are very useful and work better in some scenarios than others depending on the network, load, problem, and information needed. This is intended to be a guide to help you decide which method would be best for your scenario.",

The internal error message is: #{SelectionBean.asynchAction}: javax.faces.el.EvaluationException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.sql.SQLException: The transaction is no longer active - status: 'Marked rollback.

The precise directory location will depend of the version of Plug-in, and on the bit depth being used (32-bit or 64-bit). \n\n \n\nFor example..... \n\nIf you installed the 32-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\/opt\/IBM\/WebSphere\/Plugins\/gsk7\/lib\/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using it with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\/opt\/IBM\/WebSphere\/Plugins\/gsk7\/gsk7_32\/lib\/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v7.0 and are using it with a 64-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\/opt\/IBM\/WebSphere\/Plugins\/gsk7\/gsk7_64\/lib64\/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 32-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\/opt\/IBM\/WebSphere\/Plugins\/gsk8\/lib\/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using it with a 32-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\/opt\/IBM\/WebSphere\/Plugins\/gsk8\/gsk8_32\/lib\/ \n\n \n\nIf you installed the 64-bit Plug-in v8.x and are using it with a 64-bit Apache 2.2, use this: \n\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=\/opt\/IBM\/WebSphere\/Plugins\/gsk8\/gsk8_64\/lib64\/ \n\n \n\n \n\nPlease note that for Apache 2.2 on Linux, simply setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable from the command line prior to starting the web server, MAY NOT WORK.

    "reference_doc": "IBM Replacement of an expiring certificate on the IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance - United States\n\nSSL HTTPS TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n What is the procedure for replacing an expiring certificate that is in use on the DataPower appliance with a newly obtained certificate? \n\nCAUSE\nOnce you have obtained a new certificate from your certificate authority and are ready to replace the expiring one currently in use by your DataPower configuration with this new certificate, there is no single prescribed manner in which to perform the replacement operation. The following information presents some options for formulating an approach that best fits your environment.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nFirst, know your certificate material. It's not uncommon for newer certificates to be chained, so it is not a one for one replacement; the existing certificate on the DataPower appliance may need to be replaced by more than one certificate. Therefore, it is important to ensure you have the full certificate chain, as appropriate (i.e, the personal, intermediate and root certificates). Certificate authorities may send two certificates in the chain and expect the third one to be downloaded from their website. \n\n\nHere's a screenshot of a sample chain. Notice that you can check the 'Certification Path' tab if there are any remaining certificates in the chain. Also note the chain of \"Issued To\" and \"Issued By\" identities.\nExampleCertificateChain.jpg [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=2]ExampleCertificateChain.jpg [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=1]\n\n\nAs for the certificate configuration on DataPower, the appliance will reference the actual key and certificate files stored in the cert: directory by file name. Navigation in the WebGUI to the SSL Proxy Profile -> Crypto Profile -> Crypto Key and Certificate objects will show the current files referenced by the configuration.\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=3] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=3]\n\n\nFor example, your DataPower configuration may currently reference the existing files cert:\/\/\/current-key.pem and cert:\/\/\/current-cert.pem.\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=4] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=4]\n\nAs long as the replacement file(s) are NOT named the same as these files (i.e. the new ones are named cert:\/\/\/new-key.pemand cert:\/\/\/new-cert.pem for example), it is safe to load the new file(s) into the cert: directory at any time ahead of the replacement operation. Your existing configuration will not use the new files, so long as the Crypto Key and Certificate Objects still refer to the files associated with the expiring certificate (i.e. cert:\/\/\/current-key.pem and cert:\/\/\/current-cert.pem). \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=5] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=5]\n\nHaving both expiring and replacement files in the cert: directory at once allows for the capability to modify the configuration to point to the new files or revert it back to the expiring files relatively easily or to configure a new SSL Proxy Profile object that references the new files. The new SSL Proxy Profile could be used to test independently of the currently running configuration using a new test service such as an XML Firewall. \n\nYou can navigate directly to the key and certificate objects using these paths: \nObjects → Crypto Configuration → Crypto Certificate.\nObjects → Crypto Configuration → Crypto Key \n\nAnother view is from Control Panel -> Keys and Certificate Management.\n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=6] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21500046&aid=6]\n\nEither way, note how the configuration ultimately references the files in the cert: directory and plan ahead for how you prefer to reference the new files. \n\nThey may be swapped out within the existing Crypto Configuration objects (i.e. update the objects to reference the new file(s) or to revert to the expiring ones as needed). \n\nAlternatively, a new separate set of Crypto Configuration objects that reference the new files may be created and replacement performed at the Crypto object level by updating the configuration to reference the new replacement Crypto Configuration objects.\n\nImportant Note: If the replacement certificate has the same file name of the expired certificate, you MUST disable\/enable the certificate object in order to clear all cached references to the expired certificate.\n\nFor more information on certificates, refer to the product documentation specific to your firmware and appliance type.

In this case data to be inserted should also be in UTF-8 encoding.\n\nIf data has a different encoding then the database codepage (this can be verified using any hex editor), then the operating system codepage should be changed to match the data's encoding in order to enforce the data conversion to the database codepage. \n\nSYMPTOM\nError executing Select SQL statement.

Please verify the codepoints for non-ASCII characters that you try to insert. If you see only 1 byte per non-ASCII characters then you need to force the database conversion during insert from CLP to UTF-8 database. \n\nTo force codepage conversion during insert from the CLP make sure that the operating system codepage is non-Unicode and matching to the codepage of data when you insert data to Unicode database from non-Unicode data source. \n\nProblem Details\nAn example problem scenario is as follows:\n\n\n 1.  Create a database of type UTF-8:\n     \n     CREATE DATABASE <db> USING CODESET utf-8 TERRITORY US \n     \n     \n 2.  Create a table that holds character data:\n     \n     CREATE TABLE test (col char(20)) \n     \n     \n 3.  Check operating system locale:\n     \n     locale LANG=en_US.UTF-8 \n     LC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\" \n     \n     \n 4.  Insert the non-ASCII characters 'Ã' , '³', '©' which have codepoint 0x'C3', 0x'B3',0x'A9' in codepage 819 into the table:\n     \n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('Ã')\n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('³')\n     INSERT INTO test VALUES ('©') \n     \n     \n 5.  By running the following statement, you can see that all INSERT statements caused only one byte to be inserted into the table:\n     \n     SELECT col, HEX(col) FROM test\n     \n     \n     Ã C3\n     ³ B3\n     © A9\n     \n     However, the UTF-8 representation of those characters are: 0x'C383' for 'Ã', 0x'C2B3' for '³', and 0x'C2A9' for '©'.\n     So these three rows in the table contain invalid characters in UTF-8. \n     \n     \n 6.  When selecting from a column using the JDBC application, the following error will occur. This is expected because the table contains invalid UTF-8 data:\n     Error executing Select SQL statement.

Create a special page type attached at the batch level called something like DeleteMe. \n 2. Use an action like BlankPagesIDBySize to identify the blank page:  * BlankPagesIDBySize (1000,DeleteMe)\n    \n    \n 3. Create a rule with the action DeleteChildType(DeleteMe) and attach it at the batch level to have it remove all pages with page type DeleteMe.\n\n\nIf building a custom action, the DeleteChild API method is invoked from the parent object. \n\n * \n *",

In addition, an LDAP timeout message is added to the SystemOut.log file. \n\nSYMPTOM\nWhen you do a broad search with a small keyword, you expect to receive many entries in return. When your search is more specific, you use a longer keyword to try to narrow the search. However, when you expect fewer returns from your search, it does not happen.

All rights reserved.\nComponent: IBM(R) Tivoli(R) Monitoring OS Agents, Version 6.3.0 FixPack 5\n\nDate: 30 June 2015\n\nContents:\n\n1.0 Introduction\n1.1 Quick Start\n2.0 New Attribute groups\n3.0 Parameters in OS agent environment files\n4.0 Parameters in property file\n5.0 Examples of property file\n6.0 Examples of private situations \n7.0 Custom Scripts and Custom Scripts Runtime workspaces\n8.0 Known problems and limitations\n9.0 Troubleshooting\n10.0 Quick Start Scenario\n\n\n1. Introduction\n===============\n\nThis feature allows users to define scripts to run at Tivoli Monitoring OS agents sites at a defined frequency.\n\nThe feature is enabled by default. The administrator can enable\/disable it by setting a new environment variable \nKXX_FCP_SCRIPT=true\/false (default true)in the agent configuration file, where XX can be:\n\n- LZ for Linux OS agent \n- UX for Unix OS agent\n- NT for Windows OS agent\n\nThis is an overview of the scripting feature; details will be provided in the following sections.\n\nThe OS agent loops, at a configurable interval, looking for script definition property files (*.properties) in a configurable directory path.\nThe property files are parsed and OS Monitoring Agent spawns a new process named “fcp_daemon” if at least one valid script definition is found. This new daemon is responsible for scheduling the script executions and gathering all information regarding running scripts.\n\nAccording to another configurable interval, the OS agent loops getting the execution script results from the fcp_daemon.\nThe OS Agent is able to parse the script standard output, splitting each row in up to 16 attributes.\nAn event is sent for each standard output row of the script and these events can be caught by pure event situations.\n\n1.1 Quick Start\n================\nThe feature is enabled with default values as soon as the OS agent is started. The only action to start using the feature is the following:\n- create a property file under default directory (on Linux\/UNIX is $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/<product code>\/scripts_definitions, on Windows is %CANDLE_HOME%\\localconfig\\nt\\scripts_definitions) using as an example the provided template script_property.txt.\n\nOnly two properties are required:\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=Any name used to uniquely identify the script definition inside the property file.\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=The fully qualified path of the script with arguments. \n\nNot only shell scripts but also perl and other types of scripts can be used. You just need to specify the full command to execute in the SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS property. \nFor example, \"perl C:\\IBM\\scripts\\ITM_Custom_Scripts\\date.pl\". In this example you need to make sure that the location of \"perl\" can be resolved by the agent through the PATH variable in its environment. Specify the full path where \"perl\" is installed otherwise.\n\nFurther properties and details can be found in this document and in the template script_property.txt under $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/lz\/scripts_definitions. \n\n\n2. New Attribute groups\n=======================\n\nTwo new attribute groups have been added for this feature as detailed below. Statistic and execution data of all the scripts are stored in these two tables. The name of the property file (Property_File) and the attribute name defined in the property file (Attribute_Name) are the 2 key fields of these two tables. These two keys must be used in situation conditions to filter rows related to a specific script.\n\nAttribute group: KXX_Custom_Scripts (multiple rows), table: KXXSCRPTS (sampled).\nDescription: Configuration and statistic data gathered using custom scripts. It contains a row for each defined script, information on the fcp_daemon and on property files:\n\nAttribute Size Description\n=========================== ===== =========================\nSystem_Name 32 This is the managed system name of the agent.\nTimestamp 16 This is the local time when the data was collected.\nProperty_File 256 The name of the property file.\nAttribute_Name 96 The attribute name that is defined in the properties file. The attribute is used for metric identification.\nScript_Name 512 The name of the script.\nScript_Path 512 The fully qualified path name of the script with arguments.\nCustom_Name 96 The custom name that is defined in the properties file. It is used for custom reporting.\nStandard_Output_Type 4 Standard output type of the script.\nStatus_Code 4 The status of the script. It includes general errors, configuration errors, the status or the execution code returned by the \nScript Provider.\nExecution_Start 16 The time when the last execution of this script started.\nExecution_Duration 4 The duration of the last execution of this script, in seconds. When timing out, the value of the configured timeout is returnd.\nAverage_Execution_Duration 4 The average duration, in seconds, of all the execution of the script.\nRefresh_Interval 4 The interval, in seconds, that the agent attempts to start this script.\nNumber_of_Collections 4 The count of execution attempts of this script since agent started.\nIntervals_Skipped 4 The count of occurrences where an execution of this script is skipped because the previous execution is still running.\nProperty_Group 64 The name of the property group.\nReturn_Code 4 Integer value returned by the Script.\nCust_Label_Str1 16 Label for custom string attribute #1\nCust_Label_Str2 16 Label for custom string attribute #2\nCust_Label_Str3 16 Label for custom string attribute #3\nCust_Label_Str4 16 Label for custom string attribute #4\nCust_Label_Str5 16 Label for custom string attribute #5\nCust_Label_Int1 16 Label for custom integer attribute #1\nCust_Label_Int2 16 Label for custom integer attribute #2\nCust_Label_Int3 16 Label for custom integer attribute #3\nCust_Label_Int4 16 Label for custom integer attribute #4\nCust_Label_Int5 16 Label for custom integer attribute #5\nCust_Label_Float1 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #1\nCust_Label_Float2 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #2\nCust_Label_Float3 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #3\nCust_Label_Float4 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #4\nCust_Label_Float5 16 Label for custom floating point attribute #5\nStandard_Error 2048 Script Standard Error in a unique row\n\nIn addition to script definitions, the table may report rows to return errors found on property files and they are identified by @ANY@ as Attribute_Name. Moreover, a row is always used to report the status of fcp_daemon and it is identified by @ANY@ as Property_File and @ANY@ as Attribute_Name.\n\nAttribute group: KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime (multiple rows), table: KXXSCRRTM (pure).\nDescription: Data gathered using custom scripts.

Parameters in OS agent environment files\n===========================================\n\nIt is possible to customize the feature setting parameters in the OS agent environment files:\n- $CANDLEHOME\/config\/lz.ini file for the Linux OS agent\n- $CANDLEHOME\/config\/ux.ini for the UNIX OS agent\n- %CANDLE_HOME%\\TMAITM6_x64\\KNTENV for Windows 64bit OS agent\n- %CANDLE_HOME%\\TMAITM6\\KNTENV for Windows 32bit OS agent\n\nThe scripting feature is enabled by default. To disable it set:\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT=false\n\nOther parameters can be defined inside the agent environment files based on specific needs:\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS (default location on Linux\/UNIX is $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/<product code>\/scripts_definitions, on Windows it is %CANDLE_HOME%\\localconfig\\nt\\scripts_definitions)\nThe location where property files are stored.\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL (default 60 sec)\nOS agent uses the value of this variable as loop interval in seconds to check execution of running scripts and it sends events if the filter condition is satisfied. The minimum value is 30 seconds, the maximum value is 300 seconds. Invalid values will be reset to the default.\nNote: this parameter is ignored if KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_SCRIPT (see definition below).\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS (USE_AGENT|USE_SCRIPT|NO - default USE_AGENT)\nIf the agent looping interval defined by KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL is bigger than the script execution frequency, it can happen that data produced by some of the script execution loops is lost.\nTo avoid this behaviour the script execution frequency can be synchronized with the agent looping interval setting the KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS to:\n- USE_AGENT; the value of each script execution frequency is forced to be the maximum between KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL and EXECUTION_FREQUENCY defined in its property file. \n- USE_SCRIPT; the agent looping interval is dynamically set to the minimum frequency value (EXECUTION_FREQUENCY in property file) between all of the defined scripts . The value set by KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_INTERVAL is ignored. The frequency of the scripts remain the ones defined in the property files. When using USE_SCRIPT, the agent looping interval may change every time a script definition is added, changed or removed. In any case, it cannot be lower than the value set by KXX_FCP_OVERRIDE_MIN_FREQUENCY_LIMIT or bigger than 300 seconds.\n- NO; no synchronization is performed and some execution results could be lost.\n\n- KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL (default 300 sec) \nAt startup and at every interval defined by this variable, the OS agent checks for any changes in scripts or property files.\nNote that if KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS_CHECK_INTERVAL is less than the agent looping interval it will be reset to the agent looping interval. The maximum allowed value is the default, 300 seconds.\n\n- KXX_FCP_USER (default OS agent user)\nThis parameter is valid only on linux and unix platforms. It defines the user used to spawn fcp_deamon process if different from OS agent process user; all the scripts are executed by this user. Note that the user owner of the OS agent must have correct permission to spawn the fcp_daemon process. On windows a different user must be defined as login of the service \"Monitoring Agent for Windows OS - FCProvider\". The user must have \"Full Control\" permission to CANDLE_HOME and scripts repository directories. For more information please refer to official IBM Monitoring documentation: \nhttp:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2\/oswin\/running_as_a_non-admin_user.htm [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/knowledgecenter\/SSTFXA_6.3.0.2\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3fp2\/oswin\/running_as_a_non-admin_user.htm]\n\n- KXX_FCP_MAX_CDP_DP_THREAD_POOL_SIZE (default 10)\nIt defines the maximum concurrent number of scripts to be executed. Maximum value is 32.\n\n- KXX_FCP_MAX_DAEMON_RESTARTS (default 4)\nThe OS agent watches the fcp_daemon: if an abnormal exit of process occurs, the OS agent restarts it. This is done for the KXX_FCP_MAX_DAEMON_RESTARTS (times at a day). \nThe value 0 must be used to avoid the restart; if -1 is set, the OS agent retries to restart fcp_daemon forever. The restart counter is reset at OS agent restart.\n\n- KXX_FCP_SEND_SCRIPT_RUNTIME_EVENTS (default: true)\nIf set to false, the OS agent stops sending events for each row of script standard output. In this case script outputs are visible on TEP console workspaces but no situations will be displayed and no historical collection data will be collected. \n\n- KXX_FCP_OVERRIDE_MIN_FREQUENCY_LIMIT (default: 5 seconds) \nIt is used when KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_SCRIPT. In this condition, it sets the minimum value of the OS agent looping interval.\nUsing low values for the the OS agent looping interval (less than 5 seconds) is highly invasive and can impact OS agent performances. If a frequent data collection is needed (e.g. every second), it is strongly suggested to customize a script that caches data at the needed frequency and returns the collected data to the OS agent at an higher interval (e.g. every 60 seconds).\n\n\nThe following Agent Builder (CDP) variables can also be used to control the behavior of the fcp_daemon:\n\n- CDP_DP_REFRESH_INTERVAL (default 60 sec) Global script scheduled start time. Used if the frequency is not passed in the script property file.\n\n- CDP_DP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT (default 30 sec) Global script execution maximum time. When the execution time of a script exceeds this limit, its Status_Code is set to TIMEOUT\n\n- CDP_DP_KILL_ORPHAN_SCRIPTS (Y|N - default N) Global behaviour used by fcp_daemon process for timing out scripts. When set to 'Y', the scripts are killed, otherwise they are abandoned. This value is ignored for a specific script if the KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT key is set in the script property file\n\n- CDP_MAXIMUM_ROW_COUNT_FOR_CPCI_DATA_RESPONSES (default 1000) Global value added for performance reasons to limit the maximum number of output rows returned by the scripts. Additional rows after this limit are ignored. Allowed values are positive integer. Invalid values means no limit.\n\nThe fcp_daemon also supports the other environment variables used to control Agent Builder agents. For a complete list see the official Agent Builder documentation here:\nhttp:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/tivihelp\/v61r1\/topic\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3\/agentbuilder63_user.pdf [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/tivihelp\/v61r1\/topic\/com.ibm.itm.doc_6.3\/agentbuilder63_user.pdf]\n\n4. Parameters in property files \n===============================\n\nThe KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_DEFINITIONS directory contains a list of *.properties files. Each property file contains a list of \nscripts to run with respective properties in the form of key=value. The properties that can be defined (case in-sensitive) are: \n\n- ATTRIBUTE_NAME (Required - string max 256 characters).\nIt is a name of your choice that defines a specific script and its attributes. The characters that can be used for the \nATTRIBUTE NAME name can be alphabetical, numeric and only the underscore can be used as a special character. If other special characters (even a blank is considered this way) are used they get converted into underscore (_).\nWhen multiple scripts are listed inside the same property file, more different ATTRIBUTE_NAME must be defined (one for each script). It must be the first value specified for each defined script and delimits the start of the properties set for the specific script until the next ATTRIBUTE_NAME.\n\n- SCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS (Required - string max 512 characters).\nIt defines the full path to the script with parameters, separated by a blank. No special characters can be used in the script path name. \nValues containing blanks must be enclosed in single (') or double quotes (\").\nEnvironment variables can be passed, but only enclosed in ${...} for all the platforms. Environment variables must be available in the OS agent process context.\n\n- EXECUTION_FREQUENCY (Optional - default 60 sec).\nIt indicates the script execution frequency.\n\n- CUSTOM_NAME (Optional - string max 256 characters)\nThe user can fill it with a description of the script.\n\n- IS_ACTIVE (true|false - Optional - default true). \nIt activates the script. If false, the script is not executed.\n\n- DISABLE_USE_AGENT_SYNC (true|false - Optional - default false). If true, the EXECUTION_FREQUENCY of the script is respected also if the global variable KXX_FCP_SCRIPT_SYNC_INTERVALS is set to USE_AGENT.\n\n- KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT (true|false - Optional - default value defined by the CDP_DP_KILL_ORPHAN_SCRIPTS variable). \nWhen true the script is killed after timeout (a timeout occurs when script execution is greater than the value specified by CDP_DP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT parameter in OS agent configuration file) otherwise it is ignored. In both cases no data is collected. Note that when KILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT is set, only the script defined in property file is killed and not child processes (if any) spawned by the script. This feature is not supported by Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents and any timing out scripts are abandoned. \n\n\nOutput rows returned by a script are parsed. The script returns a standard output (called hereafter as first token). When the script returns more values in the output row they are added as additional tokens for a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats following a predefined syntax as described below:\n\n- OUTPUT_TYPE (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional - default string). It defines the type of the first token returned by each row of the script;\nOUTPUT_TYPE can be:\n1. STRING (default): strings up to 2048 characters. When used, the \"Standard_Output_String\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n2. INTEGER: allows getting numeric values between -9223372036854775806 and 9223372036854775806. When used, the \"Standard_Output_Integer\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n3. FLOAT: allows getting numeric values between -92233720368547758.06 and 92233720368547758.06,(with 2 decimal\nprecision). When used, the \"Standard_Output_Float\" attribute of KXX_Custom_Scripts_Runtime is filled in by the first token.\n\n- TOKEN_TYPES (STRING|INTEGER|FLOAT - Optional).\nIt defines the output type of additional tokens after the first one. The user can define a maximum of 5 strings, 5 integers and 5 floats. It is a list of types separated by commas:\n<token_type>,<token_type>,…\ntoken_type can be empty or one from (case insensitive):\n- STRING or S\n- INTEGER or I\n- FLOAT or F\nIf <token_type> is empty, the corresponding token is skipped.\nExamples of the same valid layouts:\n- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F\n- TOKEN_TYPES=String,integer,S,,,Float,,f,FLOAT\n\n- TOKEN_LABELS (STRING - maximum 16 characters each label - Optional). \nIt defines the labels of the tokens defined in TOKEN_TYPES. This value is a list of token labels separated\nby commas, and must correspond to the tokens defined by TOKEN_TYPES. \ne.g.:\n- TOKEN_TYPES=S,I,S,,,F,,F,F\n- TOKEN_LABELS=Cpu Name,Cpu number,Description,,,value 1,,value 2,value 3 \nIt is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set.\n\n- TOKEN_SEPARATOR (Optional - default semicolon \";\"). \nIt sets the string to be used as separator to split the output row in tokens. It is ignored if TOKEN_TYPES is not set. Empty value (blank) is accepted as separator and multiple consecutive blanks in output rows are considered as a single one.\n\n\nThe following two parameters allow you to filter the rows output of a script; they are applied by the OS agent only to the first token and they must be used together:\n\n- FILTER_VALUE (Optional).\nThe value used for comparison. It is required if FILTER_OPERATOR is defined.\nIf the OUTPUT_TYPE is a string, the filter value must reflect exactly the string value returned by the script that is intended to be filtered, without any additional quotes (no wildcards allowed).\n- FILTER_OPERATOR (Optional).\nThe operator used for the comparison. It is required if FILTER_VALUE is defined. Accepted FILTER_OPERATOR values include:\n= (equal to)\n!= (different from)\n> (bigger than) only for numeric type\n>= (not lower than) only for numeric type\n< (lower than) only for numeric type\n<= (not bigger than) only for numeric type\n\n\n\n5. Examples of property file\n============================\n\n#First script definition: script ex_script1.sh is launched every 150 seconds, it returns float values and only the output rows equal to 0.5 will be considered by the agent.\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=sample1 \nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=\/opt\/ibm\/itmd4255a\/localconfig\/lz\/scripts_definitions\/ex_script1.sh\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=150\nOUTPUT_TYPE=FLOAT\nFILTER_VALUE=0.5\nFILTER_OPERATOR==\n\n#Second script definition: script ex_script2 is launched every 60 seconds, it returns integer values and only the rows different from 0 will be considered by the agent.\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=ex_script2\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=${CANDLE_HOME}\/tmp\/check_out.sh\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=60\nOUTPUT_TYPE=INTEGER\nFILTER_VALUE=0\nFILTER_OPERATOR=!=\n\n#Third script definition: script ex_script3.sh is launched every 120 seconds with 3 input parameters (the first input parameter is an integer, the second and third are string). It's killed if it hangs or if the execution time is greater than the timeout value.\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=ex_script3 \nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=\/opt\/scripts\/ex_script3.sh 1 \"second input parameter\" \"third input parameter\" \nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=120\nOUTPUT_TYPE=STRING\nKILL_AFTER_TIMEOUT=TRUE\n\n#Fourth script definition: script cpu_mem_percentage.sh is launched every 50 seconds and returns the cpuid as standard output string and 2 float for Idle and Used CPU percentage and 2 integers for Memory and Virtual Memory usage. The pipe is used as separator to parse the output. An example of row that must be returned by the script is: \ncpu2|35,5|65,5|3443|123800\n\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=cpu and mem Usage\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=${SCRIPT_HOME}\/cpu_mem_percentage.sh\nOUTPUT_TYPE=STRING\nTOKEN_TYPES=F,F,I,I\nTOKEN_LABELS= Idle CPU %, Used CPU %, Virt MEM used MB, MEM used MB\nTOKEN_SEPARATOR=|\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=50\n\n6. Examples of private situations \n==================================\n\nThe private situations definitions can be inserted into the xx_situations.xml under $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/lz for linux or $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/ux for unix or %CANDLE_HOME%\\localconfig\\nt for Windows to monitor scripts execution.\nExamples below are for the Linux OS agent:\n\n<PRIVATESIT>\n<!-- Sends an alert if the script defined by attribute name \"demo\" in property file \"demo.properties\" returns a row equal to \"demo.log\" -->\n<SITUATION>FCP_CheckLOGFileExists_pr<\/SITUATION>\n<criteria>\n<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Property_File *EQ 'demo.properties' *AND *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Attribute_Name *EQ 'demo' *AND *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts_Runtime.Standard_Output_String *EQ 'demo.log']]>\n<\/CRITERIA>\n<\/PRIVATESIT>\n\n<PRIVATESIT>\n<!-- Sends an alert if a script exits with a return code different from zero -->\n<SITUATION>FCP_ScriptRetCode_pr<\/SITUATION>\n<CRITERIA>\n<![CDATA[*IF *VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Return_Code *NE 0]]>\n<\/CRITERIA>\n<\/PRIVATESIT>\n\n<privatesit>\n<!-- Sends an alert when script path is not defined in a property file -->\n<SITUATION NAME=\"FCP_NOPTAH\" INTERVAL=\"000030\" ><\/SITUATION>\n<criteria>\n<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Status_Code *EQ NO_SCRIPT_PATH]]>\n<\/criteria>\n<\/privatesit>\n\n<privatesit>\n<!-- Sends an alert when a script cannot be launched -->\n<SITUATION NAME=\"FCP_ScriptLaunchErr\" INTERVAL=\"000060\" ><\/SITUATION>\n<criteria>\n<![CDATA[*VALUE KLZ_Custom_Scripts.Status_Code *EQ SCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR]]>\n<\/criteria>\n<\/privatesit>\n\n\n7. Custom Scripts and Custom Scripts Runtime Workspaces\n=======================================================\n\nA new OS agent navigation item has been added in the TEP console. It contains two workspaces: \"Custom Scripts\" and \"Custom Scripts Runtime\". \n\n\"Custom Scripts\" workspace contains the following views:\n- \"Factory Daemon Status\" table view showing informational\/warning\/error events related to the fcp_daemon process.\n- \"Properties Files error\" table view showing problems related to property files.\n- \"Number of execution per script\" bar chart view summarizing the executions of defined scripts\n- \"Defined Scripts\" table view showing detailed information of defined scripts.\n\n\"Custom Scripts Runtime\" workspace is called clicking on the anchor of a specific script and provides information on script execution. The views provided by default on the TEP console are to be intended as example workspaces with all available custom attributes. Users can duplicate and customize workspaces to filter out fields that are not needed according to the output returned by their scripts.\n\n\n8. Known problems and limitations\n===================================\n\n- The Scripting Feature is not supported on Windows 2003 64-bit systems.\n- Kill after timeout does not work on Solaris and Windows 32 bit OS agents.\n- The fcp_daemon may stop executing scripts in Windows 32 bit If some scripts do not complete within the time out period and the user has turned on intensive tracing. If this happens the data reported on the TEP will reflect the last time the script was actually run. It is also possible that the OS agent will stop returning data. Terminating the fcp_daemon process will allow the agent to resume proper operation.\n- SCRIPT_NONZERO_RETURN is returned instead of SCRIPT_NOT_FOUND or SCRIPT_LAUNCH_ERROR on Solaris.\n- The scripting feature does not provide full Native Language Support; some issues may be found using Nationalized characters in property files or script outputs.\n- On windows OS agent there is no possibility of executing scripts residing on a mapped network drive.\n\n9. Troubleshooting\n===================\n\nStandard KBB_RAS1 variable will apply to the OS agent and to the fcp_daemon processes.\nTo apply a specific trace setting to fcp_daemon only, use the KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1 variable; when KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1 is set, the value specified by KBB_RAS1 is ignored by fcp_daemon.\n\nTo trace the operations logged by the OS agent core threads of the feature:\nKBB_RAS1=ERROR (UNIT:factory ALL)\n\nTo trace scripting queries from the ITM server and events sent to the server, add the entries:\n(UNIT:klz34 ALL) (UNIT:klz35 ALL) on Linux OS agent\n(UNIT:kux48 ALL) (UNIT:kux49 ALL) on Unix OS agent\n(UNIT:knt84 ALL) (UNIT:knt85 ALL) on Windows OS agent\n\nTo view tema traces to verify private situation execution, add the entries:\n(UNIT:kraavp all) (UNIT:kraapv all)\n\nTo see the execution of the scripts and how the data from the scripts is being parsed set:\nKXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1=Error (UNIT:command ALL)\n\nTo troubleshoot problems in the communication between the os agent and fcp_daemon add this trace level to both KBB_RAS1 and KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1:\n(UNIT:cps_socket FLOW) (UNIT:cpci FLOW)\n\nTo see the interaction between the OS agent process and the fcp_daemon in detail add to both KBB_RAS1 and KXX_FCP_KBB_RAS1:\n(UNIT:cps_socket ALL) (UNIT:cpci ALL)\n\n\n10. Quick Start Scenario\n=========================\n\nThe following section describes the minimum steps needed to configure a linux OS agent to run 2 custom scripts.\n\nCustom Scripts descriptions\n===========================\nLet's suppose the user has 2 scripts under a directory \/scripts_repo:\n\n- checkDIRsize.sh that checks the size of a specified directory passed as input parameter. Its output is an integer like the following: \n\n4594740\n\n- cpu_mem_usage.sh that checks the used CPU percentages and used Swap Memory megabytes. Its output is returned in the following form:\n\ncpu1|96,5|23800\n\nwhere the first token is the CPU id, the second token is the used CPU percentage, the third token is the used swap memory in megabyte.\n\nCustomization needed to have the linux OS agent run above scripts\n==============================================================\nThe feature is enabled with default values as soon as the OS agent is started:\n\n- you could create one or two property files (<Any Name>.properties)under the default directory $CANDLEHOME\/localconfig\/lz\/scripts_definitions. In this example let's create 2 property files one for each script called checkDIRsize.properties and cpu_mem_usage.properties:\n\n#CheckDIRsize.properties\nATTRIBUTE_NAME=OPT_DIR_SIZE\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=\/scripts_repo\/checkDIRsize.sh \/opt\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=20\nOUTPUT_TYPE=INTEGER\n\n#cpu_mem_usage.properties \nATTRIBUTE_NAME=cpu_mem_usage\nSCRIPT_PATH_WITH_PARMS=\/scripts_repo\/cpu_mem_percentage.sh\nOUTPUT_TYPE=string\nTOKEN_TYPES=F,I\nTOKEN_LABELS= Used CPU %, Swap MEM used MB\nTOKEN_SEPARATOR=|\nEXECUTION_FREQUENCY=10\n\n- There is no need to restart the OS agent after adding (or changing) the 2 property files above: the OS agent checks script definition directory with a specified time interval (default value 300 seconds). Open the TEP console and under the \"Custom Scripts\" workspace the scripts details and results are shown.\n\nChange History:\n----------------------\n2017-01-09: Added new item under \"8.

    "reference_doc": "IBM WebSphere DataPower spikes with high CPU when WebSphere MQ connection is unavailable - United States\n\nretries; high CPU; MQ queue manager; Retry Interval; Retry Attempts; Long Retry Interval TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n Why does WebSphere DataPower spike with a high CPU rate when a WebSphere MQ connection is unavailable? Is there a solution to this issue? \n\nCAUSE\nIf the value of Retry Attempts is set to 0 on the DataPower MQ Queue Manager object, this negates the benefits of the Long Retry Interval since it will not be used. DataPower will retry forever using the specified Retry Interval. The default setting of Retry Attempts as 0 and Retry Interval as 1 second is provided to preserve backward compatibility. However, these default values should be changed to take advantage of Long Retry Interval feature available in firmware.\n\nANSWER\nThe solution to the issue of having DataPower vulnerable to the MQ Queue Manager being inaccessible is to change the Retry Attempts parameter on the Configure MQ Queue Manager window from 0 to some number. As an example, change the parameters as follows: \n\n *  Retry Attempts - change the default of 0 to 6 Retry Interval - change the default of 1 to 10 seconds Long Retry Interval - change the default of 1800 to 600 seconds (10 minutes) \n\n\nIn the event that the Queue Manager is down or a connection is not established, the above example configuration will allow the MQ QM Object to retry 6 times with 10 second intervals. After 6 attempts, the MQ QM object will retry every 10 minutes.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Integration Appliance XI50 Firmware 3.8 Business Integration WebSphere DataPower Low Latency Appliance XM70 Firmware 3.8",

In addition to this file, README,\nyou can find more information on the WebSphere MQ Web site:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/wmq\/ [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/wmq\/]\n\nFor current information on known problems and available fixes,\nSupportPacs(TM), product documentation and online versions of this and\nother readme files see the Support page of the WebSphere MQ Web site at:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/wmq\/support [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/software\/integration\/wmq\/support]\n\nABOUT THIS RELEASE\n==================\n\nNomenclature\n------------\nThe terms \"WMQ V5.3.1\" and \"WMQ V5.3.1.0\" both refer to the same WMQ Refresh\nPack without subsequent service installed. Throughout this readme, references\nto \"WMQ V5.3.1.x\" refer to WMQ 5.3.1 with or without subsequent service\ninstalled.\n\nNew in this release\n-------------------\n\nThis is the twelfth FixPack for IBM WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 for HP NonStop Server,\nand is designated V5.3.1.12, with associated APAR IT15471.\n\nThis release is cumulative for all service and internal defect correction \nperformed since WMQ 5.3.1 was released. \n\nAll native object and executable files distributed with this FixPack have the\nfollowing version procedure strings:\n\nT0085H06_31MAY2016_V53_1_12_<buildid> (Where buildid is the internal build\nidentifier)\n\nThe Non-native library distributed with this FixPack has the following \nversion procedure string:\n\nT0085H06_28FEB2015_V53_1_11 \n\nIf upgrading from V5.3.1.5 or later releases, this FixPack does NOT require \nTNS (non-native) applications to be re-bound with the MQI library. More on \nthis is described later on in this readme.\n\nIBM have not identified any new HP NonStop Server system software problems\nsince V5.3.1.6 was released. The current set of recommended solutions is \ndescribed later on in this readme.\n\nIBM recommends that you ensure that your HP NonStop Server system software\nproducts are at SPR levels that incorporate these fixes (solutions) as a\npreventive measure. IBM has tested WMQ with these fixes in our own\nenvironment before making the recommendations.\n\nImportant note about SSL channels\n---------------------------------\n\nThis release includes a new version of openSSL (1.0.2h) to maintain currency\nwith known vulnerabilities discovered since the version shipped with V5.3.1.\nA new version of the SSLupdate.pdf document was provided with the V5.3.1.10\nfixpack, and is also included with this this release, located in the \n<install_path>\/opt\/mqm\/READMES\/en_US directory. If you use SSL channels you\nshould review the revised version of SSLupdate.pdf prior to installing this\nfixpack.\n\nThe following SSL information applies if you are upgrading from WMQ V5.3.1 and\nare using SSL channels. The following procedure is not required if you have \nalready installed WMQ V5.3.1.1\n\nSeveral of the fixes in this and previous FixPacks that relate to SSL channels\nchange the way that SSL certificates are configured with WebSphere MQ. If\nyou use SSL channels you will need to review the new documentation supplement\nSSLupdate.pdf for information about this change and make configuration changes\nPlease also see the Post-installation section below for a summary of the\nrequired changes.\n\nIn V5.3.1.10 Patch1 and all later releases, CipherSpecs that use the SSLv3\nprotocol were deprecated. Continued use of SSLv3 CipherSpec's is not recommended\nbut may be enabled by setting the AMQ_SSL_V3_ENABLE environment variable.\nIn addition to that Env01=AMQ_SSL_V3_ENABLE=1 has to be added to the MCA stanza \nof the queue manager's qmproc.ini file.\n\nWith OpenSSL 1.0.2h the following CipherSpecs have been deprecated:\nDES_SHA_EXPORT1024\nRC4_56_SHA_EXPORT1024\nRC4_MD5_EXPORT\nRC2_MD5_EXPORT\nDES_SHA_EXPORT\nTLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA\n\nWhile WMQ V5.3.1.12 does still support these weak CipherSpecs for compatibility\nreasons, they are deemed as not secure and should not be used. \n\nPlease check product documentation to confirm the CipherSpec is valid and consult\ndocumentation for any instructions when adding new environment variables.\n\n\nImportant note about WebSphere MQ V5.3 classes for Java and JMS\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFixpack V5.3.1.10 resolved an incompatibility between NonStop Java 7 and the\nWMQ product libraries - that fix is also included in V5.3.1.12.\nThe method used to configure Java in V5.3.1.10 and later differs from \nthat in releases prior to V5.3.1.10. The Java.pdf document shipped in the \n<install_path>\/opt\/mqm\/READMES\/en_US directory was updated to reflect the\nchange. Java\/JMS users migrating from versions prior to 5.3.1.10 should \nreview the updated document.\n\nImportant note about instmqm for V5.3.1\n---------------------------------------\n\nSince FixPack V5.3.1.5, IBM provided a modified WebSphere MQ product\ninstallation script, instmqm, for any level of V5.3.1. The new installation\nscript includes a workaround for the OS problem introduced in G06.29\/H06.06\nwhere the OSS 'cp' command creates Guardian files in Format-2 form during an\ninstallation rather than Format-1. This change caused problems binding and\ncompiling non-native and native COBOL applications, as well as wasting a lot of\ndisk space because of the very large default extents settings for the Format-2\nfiles created by OSS cp.\n\nInstmqm has been modified in FixPack V5.3.1.5 to work around this change in OSS\ncp by forcing all Guardian files in an installation to be created as Format-1.\nThe use of the new installation script is recommended for all new V5.3.1\ninstallations.\n\nExisting installations that are not affected by the application relink or\nrebind problems can remain as they are.\n\nProduct fix history\n-------------------\n\nThe following problems are resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.12:\n\nAPAR IT08589 - WebSphere MQ V6 or V7 queues become \"missing\" from clusters. Application\ncalls to MQOPEN (sometimes MQPUT1, MQPUT) suffer queue name lookup\nerrors (Examples: 2085, 2082) when they try to access the affected \ncluster queues. \n\nAPAR IT10388 - When the receiving QMgr has its channel set with SSLCAUTH(OPTIONAL),\nthe Nonstop Queue Manager insists on sending a certificate to \nidentify itself. The remote side, however, does not require one\n\nAPAR IT11557 - Updated OpenSSL library to version 1.0.2h. This update deprecates sslchiph \ncipherspec TLS_RSA_WITH_DES_CBC_SHA and fixes various security \nvulnerabilities.\n\nAPAR IT12856 - When a node is removed from an MQ cluster and there is an automatically\ndefined cluster sender channel from a MQ node on NonStop to the removed\nnode, the sender channel on NonStop can go into state INITIALIZING and\nstay there for up to 60 minutes instead of being deleted after the first\nretry interval has expired.\n\nAPAR IT12875 - When a message is put into a remote\/cluster queue within a TMF user\ntransaction and while the corresponding transmit queue is empty or almost\nempty, it can take up to 60 seconds after the end of the transaction\nuntil the message is transmitted. As a side effect automatic channel \nstarts can also be delayed.\n\nAPAR IT12894 - Java 7 SSL clients behave differently than previous versions which \nresulted in an RC 2009 error on its connection attempt. This\nis fixed with V.5.3.1.12.\n\nAPAR IT14169 - When a CPU is stopped, some sender channels were not recovered \nand stayed in inactive state. \n\nAPAR IT15316 - Memory allocation during MCA and LQMA creation and initialization was\nnot handled properly and may result in an unresponsive system.\n\nAPAR IT15317 - Under some conditions agents stay alive but don't accept new\nconnections. That is the case if an agent has reached the maximum \nnumber of connections it is allowed to handle during its lifetime\nbut the agent can't terminate before the last connection has been \nclosed.\n\nAPAR IT15490 - A configured process name rule has not been applied because it \nwas defined with lower case characters, while the operating \nsystem interface delivered upper case process names. Since the name\ncomparison then fails the configuration is not applied.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.12:\n\nIN000100 - The CRTMQM command may fail with error 1017 if queue managers are \ncreated in parallel.\n\nIN000101 - The installer has been enhanced to properly support SMF virtual disks\nif the system revision is on H06.26 and newer or J06.15 and newer.\n\nIN000102 - Removed access to uninitialized memory within mqconn which may result in\nRC 2059 MQRC_Q_MGR_NOT_AVAILABLE.\n\n\nFixes introduced in previous fixpacks\n=====================================\nThe following problems were resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.11:\n\nAPAR IT03572 - In V5.3.1.10, the dspmqver -V command displays the string \n\"VPROC\" rather than the VPROC string encoded in the product.\nV5.3.1.11 corrects this problem.\n\nAPAR IT04083 - Error 30 received by Queue Server in a complex Queue Manager \nconfiguration using MQGMO_SET_SIGNAL. This is a result of\nthe limit on the number of outstanding messages sent by the \nprocess not being set to the same value as the internal counter.\nThis results in the Queue Server reporting \"Guardian error 30 \nattempting to send signal notification\" in the queue manager \nerror log.\n\nAPAR IT04533 - Cluster sender channels fail to start following a CPU failure\non a 2 CPU system when the Repository Manager and Channel Server\nare both in the same CPU. Following the CPU failure, the Queue\nManager error log repeatedly reports message AMQ9422 \n\"Repository manager error, RC=545284114\" \n\nAPAR IT04876 - Some ssl channels with mismatched sslchiph cipherspecs run \nsuccessfully because protocol versions are not compared. \n\nAPAR IT05353 - Mitigation for SSLV3 POODLE Attack - CVE-2014-3566 \n\nAPAR IT07330 - WebSphere MQ V5.3.X Process does not write FDC (First \nFailure Symptom Report) records when the current FDC file is\nphysically full. This can result in processes experiencing error\nconditions, but the error condition not being reported in the \nFDC file. This fix changes the error handling to identify this\nscenario and switch to a new FDC file with an incremented \nsequence number \n\nAPAR IV19854 - The master repository manager in a partial repository \nunnecessarily subscribes to each cluster queue manager that\nit is aware of. This causes a significant increase in the number\nof subscriptions that are made, and in large clusters this can\ncause performance problems. \n\nAPAR IY87702 - SIGSEGV resulting from failed getpwnam. In some circumstances\ngetpwnam can return a success value in errno, but a null\npointer as the user record. This results in a SIGSEGV from \namqoamd. This change adds a check for this condition and handles\nit correctly. \n\nAPAR IY91357 - Altering a channel definition unintentionally resets the \nSSLPEER() attribute for the channel. \nWhen a channel with SSLPEER information is modified to include\neither MSGEXIT or MSGDATA attributes, the SSLPEER attribute \nbecomes blank. V5.3.1.11 resolves this problem. \n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.11:\n\n909 - In the GA release, the TFILE was opened with depth 100 in the\nGuardian NonStop process pairs. In configurations with large\nlarge numbers of connecting applications\/threads, this could\nresult in probe QS270000 errors from nspPrimary, with an Arith1\nvalue of 83 (0083 Attempt to begin more concurrent transactions \nthan can be handled). This change increases the TFILE open depth\nto 1000. The default value can be changed from 1000 to a value\nbetween 100 and 1000 using MQTFILEDEPTH environment variable.\nIf a value < 100 or > 1000 is specified, a value of 100 will\nbe used, and an FDC will be reported with the text\n\"Invalid MQTFILEDEPTH specified - using default\"\n\n1380 - In the cra library, several FFST code sites report an error \nwithout reporting the name of the channel involved in the error\ncondition. This change adds the channel name to the FFST report\nin cases where the channel name is available to the calling code\n\n1471 - In earlier releases of 5.3.1, if a garbage argument string is \nsupplied to dspmqfls, the command abends rather than reporting a\nusage message. V5.3.1.11 resolves this problem\n\n1597 - In earlier releases of 5.3.1, the dspmqfls output shows a \nQueue\/Status server value. Status servers were part of the V5.1\narchitecture but are not present in 5.3.1. V5.3.1.11 changes the \nmessage to reflect the fact that all objects are now managed by\nQueue Servers.\n\n2230 - In earlier releases of 5.3.1, the runmqsc command \n\"DISPLAY QSTATUS(*) TYPE(HANDLE) ALL\" does not cleanly handle a\nscenario where there are more than 500 handles. Attempts to use\nthe command when there are more than 500 handles to be returned\nresults in FFSTs with probe NS013000 from nspReply, and probe\nQS264002 from qslHandleHandleStatus. See later section on\n\"KNOWN LIMITATIONS, PROBLEMS AND WORKAROUNDS\"\n\n4158 - Slow memory leak in MQDISC in non-native library. In prior\nreleases, the non-native implementation of MQDISC contained a\nslow memory leak. This resulted in applications performing \nrepeated MQCONN\/MQDISC operations during the process lifetime\neventually receiving a MQRC_STORAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE error from\nMQCONN, and an FFST for probe ZS219001 from zstInsertPCD. The\nproblem can also manifest as a probe XC130006 from \nxehExceptionHandler inside an MQOPEN call.\n\n4395 - If memory allocation for internal working storage fails during\nan attempt to create a dynamic queue, the LQMA assoicated with\nthe operation will ABEND, rather than returning a completion\ncode of 2071 (MQRC_STORAGE_NOT_AVAILABLE). This change resolves\nthe problem.\n\n4421 - If an attempt to start an OAM server detects an existing OAM\nserver in the CPU, in prior releases, the FFST generated did not\ninclude the process name. This change amends the FFST to\ninclude the process name of the offending process, where that\nname can be determined. \n\n4428 - The altmqfls command \"resetmeasure\" was incorrectly documented\nin the original version of the SysAdmin guide. See later section\n\"DOCUMENTATION UPDATES\"\n\n4496 - In earlier versions of this readme file, the instructions on \nhow to reassign Queue Server for \nSYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMISSION.QUEUE are incorrect. Refer to the\n\"KNOWN LIMITATIONS, PROBLEMS AND WORKAROUNDS\" section for the\ncorrect procedure.\n\n4523 - If an OAM server attempts to start in a CPU, and there is \nalready an OAM server registered, prior to V5.3.1.11, the OAM\nsubsystem reported that there was a rogue process, but not\nthe name of the process. This change enhances the error\nreporting to report the name of the rogue process. \n\n4726 - Prior to this fixpack, the instmqm script did not check for\nsaveabend files and FFSTs generated during the validation\nphase of the installation. V5.3.1.11 adds this check.\n\n4774 - The cobol binding library, MQMCB, was shipped without symbols in\nFixPack V5.3.1.10, which causes applications to fail. V5.3.1.11\nresolves this issue. \n\n4800 - During instmqm, the script checks for the UNIX socket server.\nIn prior releases, in the event that this check failed, the\nerror message referred to the old UNIX socket server ($ZPMON).\nThis has been changed to refer to the new UNIX socket subsystem\n$ZLSnn, \"nn\" is the CPU number.\n\nAPAR IC85889 - UNEXPECTED IPC MESSAGES RECEIVED FOLLOWING PROCESS\nTERMINATION CAUSE EC TO ABEND REPEATEDLY\nIf a process sends an unexpected message to the MQECSVR\nprocess pair, the primary process will abend resulting in a\ntakeover by the backup process. The new primary process will\nthen abend. The only resolution is to restart the queue manager. \n\nAPAR IC87007 - PRIMARY QUEUE SERVER ABEND FOLLOWING TRANSACTION ABORT\nIn some circumstances, aborts of global units of work \ninvolving MQGETs of messages greater than 52k will result in an \nabend of the primary queue server responsible for the queue. \nThis renders the queue manager unresponsive \n\nAPAR IC87627 - WEBSPHERE MQ V5.3.1.8 FDC FILES DO NOT CONTAIN ENOUGH ERROR \nINFORMATION\n\nAPAR IC89128 - LISTENER FAILS TO START FOLLOWING UPGRADE TO \nHP J06.14\/H06.25 OR T9050J01-AWT\/T9050H02-AWS\nIn some configurations, the listener process will not run\nfollowing an upgrade to J06.14\/H06.25 or the installation of \nT9050J01-AWT\/T9050H02-AWS. The failure is dependent on the\nnumber of OSS processes running and their distribution between\nthe CPUs on the system. This problem also affects endmqlsr.\n\nAPAR IC89751 - CLUSSDR Channels do not restart without manual intervention\nafter CPU crash.\nIf a CLUSSDR or SDR channel is running in an MCA that is in the \nsame CPU as the Primary Channel Server, and that channel has \nbeen running for at least 5 minutes, and that CPU crashes, the \nchannel will not automatically restart. \n\nAPAR IC92511 - TERMINATION OF SLAVE REPOSITORY MANAGER RESULTS IN CLUSTER \nCHANNEL DELETION. In some cases this can result in a manually\nstopped cluster sender channel starting unexpectedly when they\nare dynamically recreated. \n\nAPAR IC92570 - MULTIPLE CLUSTER RECIEVER CHANNELS OR LONG RUNNING CLUSRCVR \nCHANNELS CAUSE METADATA FDC'S\n\nAPAR IC93289 - WEBSPHERE MQ R531 ON HP-NSS CLUSTER PUB SUB MESSAGES FAIL\nWITH AMQ9538 - COMMIT CONTROL ERROR \n\nAPAR IC94647 - Closing dynamic queues with MQCO_DELETE or MQCO_DELETE_PURGE\nwith an outstanding MQGET with signal results in multiple FDCs \nand an orphaned dynamic queue\n\nAPAR IC96947 - Backup Queue Server generates \"Open handle points to unused \nentry in default page\" FFST following LQMA termination \n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.10:\n\n4607 - Analyze lock logic in queue server takeover does not take account\nof temporary dynamic queues\n4679 - Exhaustion of message quickcell (MQC) space available to queue \nserver results in unstable queue manager\n4563 - RDF compatible message overflow file setting requires queue \nmanager restart \n4560 - Slave repository managers issue channel manipulation commands \nthat should be performed only by the master\n4557 - Write NonStop specific trace information to product standard \ntrace files rather than platform-specific file\n4556 - Internal Queue manager query array size can cause problems \nwith clusters containing more than 10 queue managers\n\n\nThe following problems were resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.9:\n\nAPAR IC51322 - CODE CHANGES FOR OPTIMIZATION OF DEFAULT CONVERSION\nDelay in processing seen during the default conversion between\nclient and server. The channel attempts normal conversion first,\nincluding attempting to load a conversion table before dropping\nthrough to the default conversion. Once default is required \nfor a specific set of code pages, this is now remembered \nand the attempt to perform normal conversion skipped.\n\nAPAR IY76799 - A FAILED CALL TO GETPEERNAME RESULTS IN A LEAKED SOCKET FILE\nWMQ amqrmppa (channel) process leaks a file descriptor in\nthe rare circumstance that a call to the getpeername function\nfails. Such a failed call is reported in the WMQ error logs for\nthe queue manager via an AMQ9213 message reporting that the\ngetpeername call has failed. The failure of\nthe getpeername call is the result of preoblems external to \nWMQ. This problem could also cause the WMQ listener process\n(runmqlsr) to run out of file descriptors, if there is\nno queue manager running, and lots of connections come in,\nwhilst these connections fail with getpeername problems.\n\nAPAR IY95706 - SIGSEGV IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING RETURN FROM ZFUDOESOBJECTEXIST\nAn amqzlga0 process or amqrmppa process will raise an XC130004 \nFDC and the amqzlga0 process will end. The abrupt termination of\nthe amqzlga0\/amqrmppa process may cause channels or applications\nconnected to the queue manager to fail\n\nAPAR IZ06131 - RECOVER FROM SYSTEM.AUTH.DATA.QUEUE CORRUPTED BY USER ERROR\nApplications receive MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED (2035) error\nsetmqaut returns MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME (2085) and fails to\nset new authorities. Records are missing from the \nSYSTEM.AUTH.DATA.QUEUE, determined by a mismatch between the \noutput from amqoamd -m -s, and the authorities that customers \nbelieve they have set for users and objects. This fix allows \nrecovery from this situation using setmqaut without the need \nto recreate the queue manager \n\nAPAR IC74903 - SSLPeer value slash (\/) causes SSL handshake to fail\nUsing slashes in the Distinguished Name name fields such as CN,\nO, OU, L, will fail SSLPEER value verification, and as such SSL\nHandshake, due to an MQ parsing error. MQ uses slashes (\/) to\ndelimit the distinguished name values when matching the SSLPEER\nvalue with the information contained in the certificate.\n\nAPAR IC82919 - xcsAllocateMemBlock returning xecS_E_NO_MEM\nQueue manager (receiver channel side) with API exits generate\nFDCs containing probe ZF137003 and error log entries for AMQ9518\nin the form of - File '\/mqs\/WMQtest\/var\/mqm\/@ipcc\/AMQRFCDA.DAT'\nnot found.\n\nAPAR IC80942 - Authority commands produced by amqoamd command is not usable if\nauthorization is \"+None\"\n\nUsing the setmqaut command with commands generated by amqoamd\nresults in a failure e.g\n\"setmqaut -m qmgrname -n name -t queue -g group +None\"\nreturns:\n\"AMQ7097: You gave an authorization specification that is not\nvalid.\"\n\nAPAR IC81429 - MQRC error 2003 received if an overflow file record is missing\nIf a portion of a message that should be stored the queue \noverflow file is missing, the generation of an FFST is \nsuppressed and a 2003 reason code is returned. All subsequent \nnon-specific MQGETs from the queue fail, since the partial \nmessage cannot be retrieved. \n\nAPAR IC81420 - Queue Server abend during simultaneous GET and BROWSE\nWhen a message larger than 56k is being browsed (MQGET with\none of the MQGMO_BROWSE_* options) from a client application \nusing message groups, and another process is simultaneously \nperforming a destructive MQGET on the same message. The primary\nqueue server terminates, and more or more of the following\nprobes are generated :QS003002, AO211001, AO200002, ZI074001,\nNS026006\n\nAPAR IC81367 - FixPack 5318 MQMCB Guardian library is not usable\nThe COBOL wrapper libraries were changed from type LINKFILE to\nDLL in the v5.3.1.8 Fixpack, and the packaging unintentionally\nstripped the symbols from the Guardian variant of the library\nZWMQBIN.MQMCB. During the link phase of a cobal program build\nthe following fatal error is encountered:\n\"Cannot use file specified in CONSULT or SEARCH directive\"\nProblem affects building in Guardian only.\n\nAPAR IC83299 - CPU Failure during mqget of persistent messages in global\nunit of work results in incorrectly deleted records in queue and\noverflow files\n\nIf a CPU fails where multiple applications are performing FIFO\nMQGETs from the same queue, and the following conditions are \ntrue:\n* The primary queue server is running in the failing CPU\n* Some (but not all) of the applications are running in the\nfailing CPU\n* None of the LQMAs are running in the failing CPU\n* The applications are using global units of work\n* Applications in the failing CPU have completed MQGET operations\nbut not committed the transactions\nThere is a failure window where an application not in the\nfailing CPU will remove an additional message record from the \nqueue file.\n\nAPAR IC83197 - Queue Server open handle management cannot handle backup\nrestart cases where handles from non-contiguous pages are \nsynced by the primary\n\nQueue servers with more than 3000 queue opens do not \ncorrectly handle a NonStop takeover. The queue manager becomes \nunresponsive and requires a restart to resolve the error \nsituation. When the queue server hangs, the backup queue server\nproduces a large number of FFST entries with the following \nprobe ids:\nQS165004 from qslSetHandle\nQS192007 from qslAddOpener\nQS190005 from qslHandleOpen\n\nAPAR IC83569 - Persistent Reference messages sent over a channel cause Commit \nControl Error\n\nWhen a persistent reference message is put to a queue, FFST's\nwith probe CS075003 are generated with the following error \ninformation\nMajor Errorcode :- rrcE_COMMIT_CONTROL_ERROR\nMinor Errorcode :- OK\nComment1 :- Error 2232 returned from lpiSPIHPNSSTxInfo\nIn addition, Sender channels will go into a retry state and\nqueue manager error logs will contain 'Commit Control' errors\n\nAPAR IC83699 - Cluster cache maintenance asynchronous time values result in\ncache content divergence\n\nRepository queue managers report FFST with probe RM527002\nfrom rrmHPNSSGetMetaPacket and Comment1 field \n\"Meta data mis-match Expected: metalen=4\". The problem \nresolved by this APAR is one of several possible causes of\nthese symptoms.\n\nAPAR IC83328 - Permanent dynamic queues are not deleted in some cases when\nMQCO_DELETE is used on MQCLOSE.\nPermanent dynamic queues are not deleted as expected after \ntermination of the last application that has the queue open.\n\nAPAR IC83228 - Repository manager\/Channel server deadlock\nListener process hangs on queue manager startup for 5 \nminutes then generates an FFST with probe RM264002 \nfrom rfxConnectCache\nComment1 :- Gave up waiting for cache to be initialized\nComment2 :- Tried 300 times at 1 second intervals. \nThis problem also occurs sometimes when attempting\nto use runmqsc while the queue manager is starting\n\nAPAR IY90524 - segv in xcsloadfunction for channel exit\nWebSphere MQ channel process (amqrmppa) terminates with FFST\nshowing probe id XC130003 due to a SIGSEGV SIGNAL with\na function stack as follows:\nMQM Function Stack\nccxResponder\nrrxResponder\nrriAcceptSess\nrriInitExits\nxcsLoadFunction\n\nAPAR IC81311 - MQGET implementation masks reason codes in some cases\nAttempting to perform an MQGET after a Local Queue Manager\nAgent (LQMA) process fails or has been forcibly terminated\nresults in a MQRC_UNEXPECTED_ERROR (2195). This is incorrect.\nThe result should be MQRC_CONNECTON_BROKEN (2009)\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.9:\n\n4363 - MQA process opener field is sometimes corrupted in MQGET with \nset signal operations\n4388 - Guardian sample uses the wrong link directive\n4339 - Shared hconn rendered unsuable by changes in 5317\n4123 - FASTPATH bound connect processing does not correctly set reason\ncodes in some cases\n4039 - Backup queue server abend during commit after MQGET\n3826 - altmqfls --qsize does not report failure correctly\n4116 - enhance SDCP to find installed version of OSSLS2 (T8620)\n\nThe following problems were resolved in FixPack V5.3.1.8:\n\nAPAR IC54121 - Cluster channel in a retrying state will no longer start \nautomatically if the following commands are issued \nSTOP CHANNEL() MODE(QUIESCE) STATUS(INACTIVE).\nThe channel will fail to start once communication\nto the remote system is restored. A manual start and\nstop of the channel is required to restore normal\nchannel operation\n\nAPAR IC54459 - Channel stays in binding state for a long time when it contains\nan invalid conname value. During this period, all requests to \nthe channel are ignored.\n\nAPAR IC60204 - Comamnd server experiences a memory leak when namelist\ninquireies are performed with names values.\nThe leak is observed when a PCF MQCMD_INQUIRE_NAMELIST or\nMQCMD_INQUIRE_NAMELIST_NAMES is requested that has one or \nmore names attributes.\n\nAPAR IC70168 - High CPU usage from backup Queue Server performing browse\noperations on queues with high queue depth.\nWhen a queue has a very high queue depth (CURDEPTH) a browse\ncan cause the cpu usage of the backup Queue Server to increase\nto 100%. Backup queue server CPU usage becomes significant at\na queue depth of 15000, with CPU use reaching 100% at a queue\ndepth of approx. 38000 messages.\n\nAPAR IC70947 - qmproc.ini file validation does not detect incorrect CPU syntax.\nCPU lists in the qmproc.ini file that do not use comma\ncharacters to separate CPU numbers in the list are ignored, but\nthey are not reported as an error. This can lead to unexpected\nCPU assignements for WMQ processes.\n\nAPAR IC71839 - RESET QUEUE STATISTICS PCF returns incorrect values.\nWhen using WebSphere MQ v5.3 for HP NonStop Server PCF command\nReset Queue Statistics, intermittently some of the values\nassociated with a queue will not be returned correctly.\n* HighQDepth - The maximum number of messages on the queue\nsince the statistics were last reset.\n(parameter identifier: MQIA_HIGH_Q_DEPTH).\n* MsgEnqCount - The number of messages enqueued (the number of\nMQPUT calls to the queue), since the\nstatistics were last reset.\n(parameter identifier: MQIA_MSG_ENQ_COUNT).\n* MsgDeqCount - The number of messages dequeued (the number of\nMQGET calls to the queue), since the\nstatistics were last reset.\n(parameter identifier: MQIA_MSG_DEQ_COUNT).\n\nIncorrect values may also be returned incorrectly for the\ncommand Inquire Queue Status\n* LastGetTime - Time at which the last message was\ndestructively read from the queue\n(parameter identifier: MQCACF_LAST_GET_TIME).\n* LastPutTime - Time at which the last message was\nsuccessfully put to the queue\n(parameter identifier: MQCACF_LAST_PUT_TIME).\n\nAPAR IC71912 - MQMC Channel menu display shows incorrect channel status.\nIn some instances, the MQMC Channel Menu display will not\nshow a change in channel status, and attempts to refresh the\nscreen or recycle the MQS-MQMSVR Pathway server do not correct\nthe problem. RUNMQSC continues to show the correct status. \nThe MQMC channel monitor panel does show the running channels\ncorrectly.\n\nAPAR IC73800 - A queue manager with the MaxUnthreadeAgents parameter defined\nin the QMPROC.INI file with a value greater than 812\nreports unexpected process termination FDCs and or ERROR 22\nFDCs.\n\nAPAR IC74994 - Queue manager reports message sequence number error and\nproduces FDCs with probe CS094005, major error code\nrrcE_CREATE_SYNC_FAILED following a queue manager\nrestart. \n\nAPAR IC75298 - In some complex cluster configuations with large numbers of\ncluster members, large numbers of objects, or frequent changes\nto cluster objects, the repository managers in a queue\nmanager are unable to distribute a complete set of object \nmetadata information, resulting in repeated FDCs from \nrrmHPNSSGetMetaPacket, with probe RM527001, and cluster objects\nnot being visible in some CPUs in the queue manager reporting the\nproblems.\n\nThe fix for the problem adds a new configurable parameter to\nallow the repository metadata buffers to be increased to handle\nlarger configurations, and changes the reporting of the metadata\nerrors to include information on the amount of storage requested\nby the repository managers. The default size of the buffer is \n512K, this is sufficient for most configurations. If the buffer \nsize is insufficient, the queue manager reports FDCs from \nrrmHPNSSPutMetaPacket that indicate the present size of the\nbuffer and the size demanded.\n\nThe buffer size is configured using an environment variable, \nAMQ_CLUSTER_METABUFFER_KILOBYTES. To change the value, the \nenvironment variable should be specified in the \n\"RepositoryManager\" stanza of the qmproc.ini file of the queue\nmanager using the following syntax:\n\nEnv0n=AMQ_CLUSTER_METABUFFER_KILOBYTES=x\n\nWhere \"n\" is the number of the environment variable, and \"x\" is\nthe required new size of the buffer in kilobytes. In a default\nconfiguration, environment variables are not present in the \nRepositoryManager stanza, hence \"n\" will be 1. If the \nconfiguration has existing environment variables specified in\nthis stanza, the value of \"n\" selected should be the next \navailable value. \n\nAPAR IC75356 - Partial repository queue managers in complex configurations\nwhere applications connected to the partial repository queue\nmanager attempt to open large numbers of nonexistant objects\ncan suffer from a build up of subscription objects on the \nSYSTEM.CLUSTER.REPOSITORY.QUEUE such that the TMF lock limits\nfor the volume containing the queue file are breached when the\nqueue is reconciled. This produces 2024 errors during operations\non the SYSTEM.CLUSTER.REPOSITORY.QUEUE The following error \nmessage appears in the QMgr error logs.\nEXPLANATION: The attempt to get messages from queue\n'SYSTEM.CLUSTER.REPOSITORY.QUEUE' on queue manager 'xxx' failed \n\nAPAR IY57123 - Attempts to put to a clustered queue via a queue manager\nalias when the queue has been opened using BIND_AS_QDEF\nfail. Following this fix, queue name resolution functions\nas described in the Application Programming Guide.\n\nAPAR IY78473 - Cluster workload management is not invoked if a queue is\nresolved using clustered queue manager aliases where there\nare multiple instances of the alias in the cluster.\n\nAPAR IY86606 - Cluster subscriptions are created for non-clustered queues\nwhen MQOPEN is called with non-clustered ReplyToQ or \nReplyToQMgr. This can result in a build up of subscriptions\nin partial repositories in the cluster. The error was \nintroduced by IY8473.\n\nAPAR IZ14977 - Queue manager cluster membership missing when namelists are\nused to add and remove queue managers from clusters. This can\nresult in the queue manager not acting as a repository for\none or more clusters, or other queue managers in the cluster\nnot recognizing that a given queue manager is a repository\nfor the cluster.\n\nAPAR IZ20546 - The repository manager process (amqrrmfa) consumes high CPU\nresources on an hourly basis for several minutes, and\napplications are unable to issue messaging MQ API calls\nduring this period. The problem is observed only in \nconfigurations where clustered queue manager aliases are\nused and they resolve to more than 50 destinations.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.8:\n\n1228 - COBOL Binding library mqmcb does not contain VPROC information\n1378 - FDC's cut as a result of errors from PATHWAY SPI operations do\nnot report the associated Guardian error code \n1566 - WMQ service installation tool svcmqm does not correctly detect\nand report that files it is attempting to modify are in use,\nas is the case where WMQ applications are still runnning. \n1606 - Certain FDCs containing comment text have the comment text\ntruncated \n1710 - In some cases on heavily loaded systems, the EC re-allocates\nan MCA that has already been told to terminate. This results in\nFDC's cut with probe EC134000, from eclDeallocMCA.\n2534 - WMQ service installation tool svcmqm does not log some aspects\nof its progress, making diagnosing some installation problems\ndifficult\n2856 - WMQ service installation tool should not attempt SECURE\noperations in installations where SAFEGUARD is enabled\n2943 - crtmqm does not correctly handle validation of the command line\nif a specified CPU number is invalid\n3037 - If the var\/mqm\/errors directory contains non-mqm user files \nthe WMQ service data collection tool, sdcp, does not capture the \nMQM group FDC and ZZSA files.\n3128 - WMQ Service data collection tool, sdcp, does not capture VPROC \nof the AF_UNIX R2 socket process\n\n\nThe following changes were released in FixPack V5.3.1.7:\n\nAPAR IC65774 - Under given conditions, the response time measured for MQGET\noperations when using SSL activated channels with multi-threaded\nMCA agents are found to be longer than that measured when using \nSSL activated channels with unthreaded MCA agents. This problem \nis seen with both distributed and cluster queue managers. \nMoreover, this problem does not occur prior to WMQ V5.3.1.5 \nrelease. A DELAY was introduced as part of an APAR(IC57744) fix\nin WMQ V5.3.1.5 release for mutli-threaded SSL channels which\ncaused this difference in measured response time. The problem is\nnow rectified in this release. \n\nAPAR IC67032 - Improvement to LQMA FDC during MQCONN processing. At times, when\napplication dies during MQCONN processing, LQMA's generate FDCs\nfor this rather unusual event to let the user take any \ncorrective action and\/or find the root cause. The problem can \noccur with a standard bound application in a very narrow timing\nwindow when the application connects with the LQMA agent but \ndies before the LQMA gets a chance to read the incoming message\nfrom the application. When LQMA detects this situation, it \ncleans up and generates an FDC. But unfortunately, the FDC does\nnot contain the application information. To let the user \nidentify the mis-behaving application and to possibly take\ncorrective action, LQMA FDC will be updated to include \napplication information. The updated FDC will contain the\nfollowing information :\n\nComment1 :- Application died during MQCONN Processing.\nComment2 :- Application: <Application PID> \n\nAPAR IC67057 - Unused LQMA agents(processes or threads) are found during MQCONN \nprocessing. During MQCONN processing if a standard bound \napplication fails to connect successfully to an allocated LQMA\nprocess or thread (depending on your configuration), then that\nLQMA process or thread remains in a hanging state for ever and\ndo not get re-used by Execution Controller for any further \nMQCONN processing. If an LQMA agent process ever goes into this \n\"limbo\" state, ecasvc utility shows \n\"Allocated, Pending Registration\" flag if it is unthreaded LQMA \nor a positive number against \"Conns Pending\" flag if it is a \nmulti threaded LQMA. If this problem occurrs multiple times, \nthen depending on the user configuration, it might lead to LQMA \nresource problems where Execution Controller will run out of \navailable LQMA agents to serve application MQCONN requests.\n\nAPAR IC65966 - runmqsc <queue manager name> causes FDC on a CPU due to missing\nOSS shared memory files (shm.x.x) for that CPU. Due to a yet\nunknown reason, the queue manager shared memory files for a\nparticular CPU on the system are deleted even when the queue\nmanager is in running state. This prevents any new MQ connection\nrequests from succeeding for the same queue manager on the\naffected CPU. This patch contains changes that will better\nprotect WMQ shared memory files and will prevent accidental\ndeletion of files by WMQ programs. The changes in this patch\nwill also report any such incidence by producing FDC files. The\nFDC file produced by this detection mechanism will contain the\nfollowing information :\nComment1 :- xcsIC_QUEUE_MANAGER_POOL being destroyed.\n\nAPAR IC67569 - When WMQ Queue Server detects an error due to invalid context\ndata during the completion of a TMF transaction started by the\nQueue Server for a PUT or GET no-syncpoint persistent message\noperation, it marks the message on the queue object as \naccessible. This causes the Queue Server to FDC with \n\"Record not found\" on any subsequent MQGET operation to retrieve\nthe same message. The particular message on the queue that has \nthis problem remains in this limbo state forever and can not be\nretrieved. However other messages on the same queue that do not\nhave this problem can be retrieved without any problem using \ntheir msgids. The Queue Server has been revised to correct this\nbehavior such that detection of inconsistent context data during\nMQPUT\/MQGET is logged in the form of an FDC but is otherwise \ncommitted as a normal operation. This will resolve the problem\nof MQGET failing on the retrieval of the message.\n\nAPAR IC68569 - Channel server FDCs during starting\/stopping of channels. The \nproblem occurrs due to a defect in the product where the channel\nserver erroneously closes its open to Queue Server but assumes \nthat its open to Queue Server is valid. The open handle \nto Queue Server after it is closed, gets reused by another open\nand hence any subsequent communication by Channel Server to \nQueue Server always fails. Typically, this problem is seen when\nthe Channel Server experiences transient socket errors with the \nchannel agent (MCA) and it wants to close the socket connection.\nAfter closing the socket connection, Channel server sends a \nmessage to Execute Controller process to de-allocate the MCA\nwith which it had socket error with. It is during this \ncommunication between the Channel Server and the Execution\nController when the Channel Server erroneously closes the open\nto the Queue Server.\n\nAPAR IC69572 - Channel server abends due to illegal address reference during\nadopt MCA processing. This problem happens if the Queue Manager\nhas enabled adopt MCA processing to a remote WMQ Queue Manager\nthat does not send a remote queue manager name during channel\ninitialization\/negotiation. The remote Queue Manager field\nremains NULL and during the Adopt MCA processing logic,\nthe channel server incorrectly references the NULL pointer and\nabends. \n\nAPAR IC69932 - SNA WMQ listener fails to start the channel when HP SPR \nT9055H07^AGN is present on the NonStop system. HP, in its SPR\nSPR T9055H07^AGN, changed the behavior of sendmsg() API if '-1'\nis used as a file descriptor to the API. This caused \nincompatibility with WMQ SNA listener process. WMQ code has now \nbeen revised to work with the updated sendmsg() behavior. \n\nAPAR IC69996 - WMQ Queue Server generates FDC with reply error 74. When an\napplication with a waiting syncpoint MQGET suddenly dies \nbefore getting a reply, the Queue Server can cause FDC \nsometimes. This happens in a narrow timing window when a message\nbecomes available on the queue and the Queue Server starts \nprocessing the waiting MQGET request. If the application dies\nafter Queue Server starts processing the waiting MQGET request, \nthen Queue Server detects the inherited TMF transaction error \nand replies back with error 2072 (MQRC_SYNCPOINT_NOT_AVAILABLE).\nHowever in this case, Queue Server erroneously does not delete\nits internal waiter record for MQGET. When the timer pops for\nthe waiter record, Queue Server attempts to reply back with\nno message available but the call to Guardian REPLYX procedure\nfails with error 74 as the reply to the same request has already\nbeen made(with error MQRC_SYNCPOINT_NOT_AVAILABLE). This causes\nthe Queue Server to FDC.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.7:\n\n363 - WMQ Queue Server under certain conditions fails to handle non-persistent\nand persistent segmented messages at the same time.\n1317 - Support for parallel execution of multiple endmqm programs on the same\nQueue Manager. \n1404 - MQGET WAIT is not being rejected with error 2069 when there is an \nexisting MQGET set signal on the same queue handle. \n1434 - svcmqm utility fails when install files are open but does not tell the \nuser which files are open. \n1566 - svcmqm does not exit immediately when 'cp' command fails to copy \nbinaries during fixpack installation.\n1679 - WMQ Queue Server generates FDC while failing to open the message \noverflow file during retrieval of very large messages (equal to or \nlarger than 'Message Overflow Threshold' displayed with dspmqfls \nutility).\n1709 - instmqm changes related to the use of \/opt directory for the creation of\nbackup archive file.\n1789 - Port of distributed APAR IY66826. Cluster sender channel does not start\nand Queue Manager cache status remain in STARTING state.\n1780 - Port of distributed APAR IY85542. RESET CLUSTER command does not remove \ndeleted repository entry.\n1993 - Enhancement to WMQ mqrc program to print messages related to errors \nbeing returned on NonStop platform.\n2018 - WMQ lqma agent process leaks catalog file open.\n2181 - svcmqm does not output the fixpack that is being installed.\n2282 - instmqm -b archives everything under \/opt directory.\n2290 - Enhancement to Execution Controller process to aid development dubugging\nand troubleshooting.\n2534 - svcmqm has no log of its progress.\n2580 - Potential SEGV in internal function call during Pathway serverclass \nstarting.\n2632 - Incorrect message output in FDC generated by WMQ Queue Server during \nnsrReply function call.\n2633 - WMQ Command Server memory leak found in CLEAR QL command.\n2842 - WMQ Repman process priority was not set correctly when the \nqmproc.ini 'AllProcesses' stanza Priority attribute is configured. \n\nThe following serviceability fixes were made to the SDCP tool:\n\n1971 - sdcp data was not collected correctly when there is a default \nQueue Manager defined.\n2211 - sdcp testing of the permission of \/tmp directory.\n2289 - sdcp logging of progress to a file to aid in sdcp problem diagnosis.\n2298 - sdcp performance improvement.\n2531 - sdcp logging of scheduled CPU information.\n2582 - sdcp capture of Pathway data for PATHMON, PATHWAY, TCP, PROGRAM\nand TERM attributes.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.6:\n\nAPAR IC60204 - A Memory leak occurs with repeated DISPLAY NAMELIST command. The\nleak is observed only when the NAMELIST(s) has one or more NAMES\nvalues defined. The problem is observed from within the runmqsc\nDISPLAY NAMELIST command, or from the PCF\/MQIA equivalent. Tools\nthat request NAMELIST data via the command server with PCF\/MQIA\nrequests such as WMQ Explorer will cause the WMQ command server\nmemory to grow.\n\nAPAR IC61324 - An orphan MCA problem occurs when a connection request from WMQ\nLISTENER or CHANNEL SERVER process to an MCA process fails. WMQ\nExecution Controller (EC) process fails to recognize the\nsituation and does not re-use the MCA process for future agent\nallocation requests. Over a period of time, this problem can\ncause the queue manager to run out of MCA resources which may\nlead to a situation where no new channel can be started. The\nproblem is observed during heavy load conditions where the WMQ\nExecution Controller(EC) process hands over a selected MCA\nprocess to LISTENER\/CHANNEL SERVER before the MCA process\nbecomes ready to accept connection requests.\n\nAPAR IC61551 - The use of cluster administrative command\nRESET CLUSTER ACTION(FORCEREMOVE), to forcibly remove a Queue\nManager out of the cluster can cause FDCs. The problem can cause\nmultiple FDCs and sometimes abend in WMQ REPMAN process in a\nslave role. Once the command has been issued and the error has\noccurred, the concerned Queue Manager must be restarted to\nrestore the clustering function to normal operation. The problem\noccurs because WMQ REPMAN process in a master role does not\ndistribute the RESET CLUSTER ACTION(FORCEREMOVE) command to the\nslave REPMAN processes correctly.\n\nAPAR IC61651 - When a NAMELIST object with one or more NAMES values is defined\nfor a Queue Manager and a dspmqfls command is issued to retrieve\nthe details of either all objects under the Queue Manager or\nthe specific NAMELIST object, FDCs are seen from the WMQ LQMA\nprocess. The problem exists for both unthreaded and\nmulti-threaded LQMA process. The problem occurs because WMQ LQMA\nprocess does not allocate sufficient memory for NAMES buffer\nduring dspmqfls processing.\n\nAPAR IC61660 - A PCF RESET QUEUE STATISTICS command causes the WMQ QUEUE SERVER\nprocess to FDC. The problem occurs during a timing window when\nthere is an outstanding unit of work on the queue and a\nRESET QUEUE STATISTICS command is processed and then the\noutstanding unit of work is backed out. RESET QUEUE STATISTICS\ncauses certain internal counters inside WMQ QUEUE SERVER to be\nreset to zero without taking into account the outstanding unit\nof work. If the outstanding work is later backed out for any\nreason, the already reset counters become negative which causes\nan internal consistency check to fail within the QUEUE SERVER\nprocess and the FDC is generated.\n\nAPAR IC61681 - WMQ QUEUE SERVER causes FDC during MQCLOSE processing on a\ncluster alias queue. The problem occurs during MQCLOSE\nprocessing of a cluster QALIAS object hosted by a different\nQUEUE SERVER than that hosts the target local queue. MQOPEN\nincorrectly failed to allocate an internal handle for the QALIAS\nobject if it was a cluster alias queue. This lead to the FDC\nduring MQCLOSE processing.\n\nAPAR IC61846 - When a START CHANNEL command is issued after WMQ trace is\nenabled, the SSL channel logs a Queue Manager error message and\nfails to start.\nThe problem exists only for a SSL channel, no such problem\nis found for regular (non-SSL) channel. The problem occurs\nbecause of an incorrect implementation of NULL terminated string\nto store SSL Cipher data.\n\nAPAR IC61920 - WMQ on NonStop reports an extra EMS message when the generation\nof an FFST is reported.\nThe intention behind the second EMS message was to report the\ncase when the open of the generated FFST file fails but the\ncheck to see the status of the opened FFST files was missing\nin the code.\n\nAPAR IC62341 - A Security error from the WMQ OAM server is not propagated\ncorrectly. It was reported as MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME instead\nof MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED. When running the Java IVP (MQIVP) to NSK\nwith a non-mqm user specified as the MCAUSER in the SVRCONN\nchannel, and if the non-mqm group isn't given authorization,\nMQIVP fails to connect to the Queue Manager\nwith an authorization failure (MQRC_NOT_AUTHORIZED) but it is\nreported incorrectly as a MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME error.\n\nAPAR IC62389 - A REFRESH CLUSTER command within a cluster with more than two\nrepositories causes the Repository Manager to fail. The problem\nis not common in normal cluster operation but is likely if\nextensive administrative changes are being made to the cluster\nthat includes a REFRESH CLUSTER command. Incorrect distribution\nof channel status information across multiple copies of the\nREPOSITORY MANAGER cache in different CPUs of the system lead to\nthe FDC.\n\nAPAR IC62391 - Sometimes cluster queues are not visible on CPUs hosting WMQ\nREPOSITORY MANAGER process in a slave role. This is a cluster\nqueue visibility problem across the CPUs. Any attempt to open\nthe cluster queue on CPUs that have the visibility problem\nresults in error MQRC_UNKNOWN_OBJECT_NAME or\nMQRC_CLUSTER_RESOLUTION_ERROR.\nThe problem does not occur on the CPU that hosts WMQ REPOSITORY\nMANAGER process in a master role.\n\nAPAR IC62449 - The WMQ QUEUE SERVER does not log storage related problems to\nthe Queue Manager log. Some of NSK storage related errors like\nerror 43 and error 45 are useful errors for which corrective\naction can be taken to restore normal operation.\nThe WMQ QUEUE SERVER now logs these errors to Queue Manager log.\n\nAPAR IC62480 - Port of IZ51686. Incorrect cache object linkage causes\nunexpected failures (AMQ9456) based on coincidental event\nsequences.\n\nAPAR IC62511 - Port of the following clustering-related APARs from other\nplatforms and versions:\nIZ14399 - Queue managers successfully rejoin a cluster when\nAPAR IY99051 is applied but have mismatching sequence\nnumbers for the cluster queue manager object and its\nassociated clusters.\nIZ21977 - MQRC_OBJECT_CHANGED(2041),\nAMQ9511 SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE,AMQ9448,\nRepository manager ends.\nIZ37511 - Generation of an FDC by the Repository Manager causes\nit to terminate.\nIZ14977 - Missing cluster information when Namelists are used\nto add and remove queue managers from multiple\nclusters at once.\nIZ36482 - Changes to CLUSRCVR shared using a Namelist not\npublished to all clusters.\nIZ10757 - Repository Manager process terminates with error\nRRCI_CLUS_NO_CLUSRCVR_DEFINED.\nIZ41187 - MQRC_CLUSTER_PUT_INHIBITED was returned when an out-\ndated object definition from the cluster repository\nwas referenced.\nIZ34125 - MQ fails to construct and send an availability message\nwhen REFRESH CLUSTER REPOS (YES) is issued on a queue\nmanager with more than 1 CLUSRCVR.\n96181 - Object changed problems with the Repository manager.\nIY97159 - Repository Manager process tries to access the cache\nwhile restoring the cache, resulting in a hang.\nIZ44552 - AMQ9430 message after REFRESH CLUSTER.\n135969 - Refresh bit not set when demoting QM to partial repository.\n\nAPAR IC62850 - The md.Priority of a message was not being set to the queue\nDEFPRTY when a no syncpoint MQPUT is performed using\nMQPRI_PRIORITY_AS_Q_DEF while there is a waiting MQGET.\nA syncpoint MQPUT with a waiting MQGET does not have this\nproblem.\n\nAPAR IC63081 - A WMQ application abends in the MQI library when attempting to\nenqueue messages to a Distribution LIST with one queue entry.\nAlso in certain circumstances, WMQ applications may receive\nincorrect status and reason code while using Distribution LISTS.\n\nAPAR IC63105 - A Memory leak occurs in the WMQ COMMAND SERVER with repeated\nDISPLAY QSTATUS command. The leak is observed only when\nTYPE HANDLE is used with the above command. The problem also\noccurs from within runmqsc DISPLAY QSTATUS command, or from the\nPCF\/MQIA equivalent. Tools that request queue status data via\nWMQ COMMAND SERVER with PCF\/MQIA requests such as WMQ Explorer\nwill cause the WMQ COMMAND SERVER memory to grow.\n\nAPAR IC63271 - When an MQ application delays in replying to the HP system OPEN\nmessage from the WMQ QUEUE SERVER and an MQ message arrives on\nqueue during this period, the MQ message did not get delivered\neven after the reply to the HP system OPEN message is made.\n\nAPAR IC63757 - In a standard bound application, a memory leak occurs in WMQ\nLQMA process during MQCONN\/MQDISC processing. The problem occurs\nwith both unthreaded and multi-threaded LQMA process. If the\nLQMA agents are configured to have high use count\n(MaxAgentUse for unthreaded LQMA and MaxThreadedAgentUse for\nmulti-threaded LQMA) and WMQ Execution Controller process\nre-uses the same LQMA process to satisfy a application MQCONN\nrequest, then the heap memory of LQMA process grows even if\napplication calls MQDISC to disconnect from the\nQueue Manager.\n\nAPAR IC64297 - WMQ Queue Manager becomes non-responsive because the\nWMQ QUEUE SERVER does not clean up the internal queue manager\nobject opens. The QUEUE SERVER internal links for\nMQOPEN of the Queue Manager object were not\nbeing released during the MQCLOSE processing. This causes a\nbuildup of QUEUE SERVER memory as the application repeated\nMQOPEN of the queue manager object repeatedly. When either\na MQDISC occurred or the application process ended,\nthe QUEUE SERVER cleans up its internal lists for the process.\nThis resulted in a perceived QUEUE SERVER loop and\nnon-responsive WMQ as there were\nover 246,000 opens found of the Queue Manager object with a\nhigh mark of 548,000 within the QUEUE SERVER when a dump of the\nQueue Server was analyzed.\nMQOPEN of other MQ objects (qlocal, qalias, qremote etc.) do not\nhave this issue.\n\nAPAR IC64373 - The COBOL copybook now includes missing definitions for MQGET\nSET SIGNAL processing.\n\nAPAR IC64435 - An incorrect persistence attribute was being set for a\nnon-persistent message on XMIT queue. When MQPUT of a\nnon-persistent message is done using MQPER_PERSISTENCE_AS_Q_DEF\nattribute to a remote queue while the channel is idle, the MD\nMD data in transmit queue header contained\nMQPER_PERSISTENCE_AS_Q_DEF value of (2).\n\nAPAR IC64630 - It takes longer for unthreaded SSL sender channel to end when\ncommunication to the remote Queue Manager is lost. The problem\noccurs because the unthreaded MCA process running the SSL channel\nfails to timeout correctly causing the channel to end differently\nthan non-SSL channels. The problem is observed only with SSL\nchannels and no such problem is visible with regular SSL \nchannels. \n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work are\nalso released with V5.3.1.6:\n\n1096 - An MQGET BROWSE operation can return prematurely with no message\navailable as well as can cause a waited GET to hang indefinitely.\n1513 - amqrrmit erroneously reports multiple master REPMAN processes.\n1587 - Enhancements to Execution Controller log messages pertaining to\nThreshold and MaxAgent capacity situations. For unthreaded agents,\nthe \"max unthreaded agents reached\" message will now be logged when the\nMaxUnthreadedAgent is allocated to perform work. In previous releases,\nthe message was logged when the MaxUnthreadedAgent was added to the idle\npool, which actually left one agent still available for use.\nFor threaded agents, messages have been enhanced to display separate\nThreshold\/Maximum messages for agents and threads. In previous releases,\n\"further connections refused\" was displayed when the MaxThreadedAgent\nwas started, which actually left MaximumThreads connections still\navailable for use. In this release \"further connections refused\" will be\ndisplayed when the MaximumThread is allocated for use.\nAlso in this release, messages will be logged when the number of agents\nor threads, after having exceeded the threshold or reached maximum,\nfall below the Maximum or threshold limit.\n1669 - ZCG_FFST does not report the error code for a TMF error.\n1675 - The Execution Controller now provides an API to mark MCAs that are no\nlonger used.\n1670 - Correction to missing component data in a FDC generated by the\nQueue Manager server(MQS-QMGRSVR00) process(amqqmsvr).\n1678 - Queue server abends due to uninitialized FFST inserts.\n1706 - dmpmqaut -m <qmgr> sometimes only reports the first QALIAS object and\nFDCs in kpiEnumerateObjectAuthority.\n1710 - The Execution Controller sometimes allocates an MCA that it has\npreviously asked to end\n1712 - Cluster queue manager STATUS and queue visibility problems in slave\nREPMAN.\n1734 - Fixes\/Updates to MQ tracing mechanism.\n1735 - Subscription id distribution.\n1751 - Fixes\/Updates to MQ tracing mechanism.\n1807 - Changes to improve service and debug capability of Execution Controller\nstarted processes.\n1873 - \"*\" subscriptions are generated incorrectly causing them to be ignored.\n1989 - Fix for channel server hanging problem while opening REPMAN process.\n2003 - LQMA now FDCs when a invalid message is received.\n\nThe following serviceability fixes were made to the SDCP tool:\n\n1659 - sdcp is not capturing the PSTATE of backup processes.\n1676 - sdcp takes too long.\n1690 - sdcp MQ utilities are not using the correct Queue Manager name if\nthe name is mangled because of non-alphabetic characters.\n1702 - sdcp doesn't collect all relevant Saveabend files.\n1705 - sdcp workaround to avoid APAR IC61651.\n1971 - sdcp now gives correct output for default Queue Manager.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.5:\n\nAPAR IC55607 - FDC files can fail to be written, or written to the wrong file\nFDCs can be suppressed or overwritten when application processes\nraise FDCs under User IDs that are not members of the MQM group.\nIn addition, because FDC files are named with the CPU and PIN of\nthe generating process, and PIN is reused frequently on\nHP NonStop Server, FDCs from different processes can be appended\nto the same file.\n\nThe format of the file name for FDCs is:\nAMQcccpppp.s.FDC\n\nwhere ccc is the CPU number\npppp is the PIN\ns is the sequence number\n\nIn V5.3.1.4 and earlier releases, the sequence number was\nalways set to 0. This fix introduces the use of the sequence\nnumber field to ensure that FDCs from different processes are\nalways written to different files, and that FDCs can always be\nwritten. FDC files are created with file\npermissions \"rw-r----\" to prevent unauthorized access to the\nFDC data.\n\nAPAR IC57435 - Attempts to end a queue manager with either -t or -p following\na cpu failure in some cases did not work as a result of\ndamage to the WMQ OSS shared memory files. The shared memory\nmanagement code was revised to tolerate OSS shmem\/shm files\ncontaining invalid data. Invalid data in these files is now\nignored and memory segment creation will continue normally.\n\nAPAR IC58165 - Triggered channels sometimes do not trigger when they should\nSome attributes of a local queue that determine if trigger\nmessages get generated are not kept up to date for long-running\napplications. The most critical attribute is the GET attribute\nthat controls whether MQGET operations are enabled for a queue\nor not. If the application opened the triggered queue while\nthe queue was GET(DISABLED), and the queue is subsequently\nmodified to be GET(ENABLED), triggering will not occur when it\nshould.\n\nAPAR IC58377 - Trace data is not written when PIDs are reused for processes\nrunning under different User IDs.\nTrace files are named according to the CPU and PIN of the process\nthat is being traced. On HP NonStop Server, since PINs are\nrapidly reused, it is likely that a process attempting to write\ntrace data will encounter an existing file written with the same\nCPU and PIN. The traced process will be unable to write data if\nthe original file was written (and therefore owned) by a\ndifferent User ID.\n\nThis fix introduces a sequence number into the trace file names\nto prevent trace file name collisions.\n\nThe format of trace file names will change from:\n\nAMQccppppp.TRC to AMQccppppp.s.TRC\n\nwhere s is a sequence number that will usually be 0.\nTrace files are now created with file permissions \"rw-r----\"\nto prevent unauthorized access to the trace data.\n\nAPAR IC58717 - The Queue Server backup process generates FDCs showing ProbeId\nQS123006 from qslHandleChpPBC when attempting to locate a browse\ncursor message, with the comment text of\n\"Error locating Last Message in Browse Cursor checkpoint in\nBackup\" or \"Error locating Last Logical Message in Browse Cursor\ncheckpoint in Backup\". The problem appears only when running a\nnumber of parallel browse \/ get applications for the same queue\nobject.\n\nAPAR IC58792 - strmqm fails to delete orphaned temporary dynamic queues if the\nassociated touch file is missing. This results in these queues\nremaining in the object catalog indefinitely, and FDC files\nbeing generated each time the queue manager is started,\nreflecting the fact that the queue could not be deleted. The\nhousekeeping function was modified to always silently remove\ntemporary dynamic queue objects from the catalog, whether or\nnot they are damaged. FDC files are no longer generated.\n\nAPAR IC58859 - wmqtrig script does not pass TMC with ENVRDATA correctly.\nIf ENVRDATA is part of the PROCESS definiton used by\nrunmqtrm to trigger applications the TMC is not delivered to\nthe application correctly. The problem does not occur with\nblank ENVRDATA. Additionally, ENVRDATA or USERDATA attributes\nthat contain volume names ($DATA for example) are not processed\ncorrectly by the wmqtrig script.\n\nAPAR IC58891 - Sender channels that were running in a CPU that failed are not\nrestarted in some circumstances. Sender channels that are not\nrestarted report \"AMQ9604: Channel <...> terminated\nunexpectedly\" in the queue manager error log, and the channel\nserver create FDCs with ProbeID RM487001, Component\n\"rriChannelTerminate\".\n\nAPAR IC58976 - A server channel without a specified CONNAME enters a STOPPED\nstate when the MCA process running the channel is forcibly\nstopped or ends following a CPU failure. The channel state\nshould be set to INACTIVE following this type of event. To\nrecover the situation the channel has to be manually restarted\nor stopped using MODE(INACTIVE).\n\nAPAR IC59024 - The copyright data in the COBOL COPYBOOK CMQGMOL file\nis incorrect.\n\nAPAR IC59126 - Context data is missing in COA message.\nWhen an MQPUT application sends a message with COA report\noption, the generated replied COA message does not contain\ncontext data eg. PutDate, PutTime, etc.\n\nAPAR IC59364 - Queue Server primary incorrectly commits an WMQ message in\ncertain cases where the backup process has failed to process\nan internal checkpoint message. This causes an inconsistency\nbetween the primary and backup processes when an MQGET is\nattempted on this message, resulting in FDCs with the comment\ntext \"Invalid Message Header context in Backup for Get\" from\nComponent \"qslHandleGetCkp\". The queue object is no longer\naccessible via MQGETs, but can be recovered by stopping the\nbackup process.\n\nAPAR IC59388 - V5.3 OAM Implementation contains migration logic which may be\ntriggered erroneously in some circumtances, removing authority\nrecords from the SYSTEM.AUTH.DATA.QUEUE. This change removes the\nmigration logic, since there are no previous versions of the\nOAM which require migration.\n\nAPAR IC59395 - Threaded LQMA actual usage is one larger than the configured\nmaximum use count in the qmproc.ini file. Unthreaded LQMAs\nand MCAs (both threaded and unthreaded) do not suffer from this\nproblem.\n\nAPAR IC59428 - In some circumstances where connecting applications terminate\nunexpectedly during the MQCONN processing, either by external\nforcible termination, or as a consequence of other failures that\n\nresult in termination, the resulting error can cause the LQMA\nprocess handling the application to terminate. This will\ncause collateral disconnections of all other applications using\nthe same LQMA, with the application experiencing either a 2009\n(connection broken) or 2295 (unexpected) error. The problem\nwindow occurs only during one section of the connect protocol\nand has been observed only on very busy systems with repeated\nmultiple forced terminations of applications.\n\nAPAR IC59742 - qmproc.ini file will fail validation if configured with both\nMinIdleAgents=0 and MaxIdleAgents=0.\n\nAPAR IC59743 - Queue Manager server expiration report generation is not fully\nconfigurable. The frequency with which the queue manager server\ngenerates expiration reports is configurable but the number of\nreports generated is not. This change introduces a new\nenvironment variable (MQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE), to allow\nconfiguration of the number of expiration reports generated\nat any one time. The parameter can be added to the WMQ\nPathway MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass:\nALTER MQS-QMGRSVR00, ENV MQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE=<1-99999>\nIf this value is not specified in the queue manager\nserverclass configuration, the value defaults to 100.\n\nAPAR IC59802 - Memory leak occurs with repeated DIS CHSTATUS SAVED command.\nA memory leak exists in the Channel Saved Status query. This\nleak is observed within either the runqmsc DISPLAY CHSTATUS\n\nSAVED command, or the PCF\/MQIA equivalent. Tools that request\nsaved channel status data via the Command Server with PCF \/ MQIA\nrequests such as WMQ Explorer will cause the Command Server\nmemory to grow.\n\nAPAR IC60114 - WMQ processes or user application processes generate FDCs\nreferring to \"shmget\" following forcible termination of the\nprocess or failure of the CPU running it. This is a result of\nthe Guardian C-files (Cnxxxxxx) for a CPU becoming corrupt\nduring an update operation, rendering the file and associated\nshared memory segment unusable. C-file update operations are\nnow performed atomically to prevent this problem.\n\nAPAR IC60135 - Improve servicability of the \"endmqm -i\" command to prevent the\ncommand from waiting indefinitely for the queue manager to end.\nFollowing this change after a specified number of seconds, the\ncommand will complete with the message \"Queue Manager Running\"\nand return to the command line with exit status 5.\n\nAPAR IC60175 - Description is not available (security\/integrity exposure)\n\nAPAR IC60361 - Memory leak occurs in SVRCONN channel MCAs which repeatedly open\nlocal queue objects.\n\nAPAR IC60455 - WMQ Broker restart may not work correctly.\nIf the WMQ Broker is restarted using strmqbrk\/endmqbrk,\nsubsequent attempts to restart the broker may fail, and 2033\nerrors my arise when running the test broker samples and\nrecycling the broker processes.\n\nAPAR IC60119 - System Administration manual incorrectly states the default\nvalue of the TCP\/IP Keepalive is \"ON\"\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nreleased with V5.3.1.5:\n\n1403 Erroneous SVRCONN channel ended message.\nSVRConn channels should not generate \"Channel Ended\" messages in\nthe error log, but in some circumstances, threaded svrconn\nchannels do generate these messages.\n1451 Internal changes relating to trace and FDC files sequence numbers\n1453 Problem with MQCONN after restart of broker\n1516 strmqm fails with invalid ExecutablePath attribute (qmproc.ini)\n1560 Port of V51 MQSeries for Compaq NonStop Kernel APAR IC57981.\nBackup Queue Server runs out of memory processing non-persistent\nmessages in 27K range. \n1564 runmqlsr abends in nssclose after a previous 'socket' calls fails\n1570 Added Agent type to EC logged threshold and max agent messages.\n1576 Change ECA interface to V4\n1577 Queue Server message expiration deletion phase log message\n1583 Blank channel status entries can get created triggering\nchannels when AdoptMCA is enabled.\nUnder certain timing situations, when triggered channels are\nused and AdoptMCA is enabled for the queue manager, blank\nchannel status entries can be created with the JOBNAME\nreferencing the Channel Initiator (runmqchi), for example:\nAMQ8417: Display Channel Status details.\nCHANNEL() XMITQ()\nCONNAME() CURRENT\nCHLTYPE() STATUS(BINDING)\nMSGS() BATCHES()\nJOBNAME(5,333 $MQCHI OSS(318898190)) RQMNAME()\nThis problem does not cause any immediate functional problem,\nhowever the blank entries consume channel status table entries\nand therefore could prevent legitimate channel starts in the\nevent that the status table becomes full.\n1594 C++ unthreaded libraries use threaded semaphores\n1596 Improved cs error reporting\n1597 EC started processes sometimes not started in intended CPU\n1598 NSS Incorrect component identifiers used in some parts of zig\n1608 Queue status errors on failure of a no syncpoint persist message\nput or get\n1601 Tracing details to the EC to augment the Entry and Exit trace\ncalls\n1611 LQMA Queue manager attribute corruption\n1613 Enhanced LEC Failure Handling\n1615 The EC may allow the os to choose in which cpu a MCA will start\n1616 Channel server comp traps have potential performance impact.\n1621 MQCONN does not report valid reason code when agent pool is full\n1622 After a channel is started dis chs displays \"binding\" in some\ncircumstances when it should display \"running\"\n1623 Incorrect message when MCA allocation fails\n1626 Addition of Service information collection tool (SDCP)\n\nNew platform support was released in V5.3.1.4:\n\nFixpack V5.3.1.4 introduced support for the HP Integrity NonStop BladeSystem\nplatform, NB50000c. Use the H-Series (Integrity) package of WebSphere MQ\nfor execution on the BladeSystem. Please refer to the Hardware and Software\nRequirements section for details about the levels of the J-Series software\nrequired.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.4:\n\nAPAR IC57020 - runmqtrm does not function correctly and produces errors in some\ncases.\nWhen a triggered application is a guardian script file\n(ie filecode 101). runmqtrm produces an \"illegal program\nfile format\" error. Triggering also does not work correctly\nfor COBOL or TAL applications.\n\nAPAR IC57231 - The execution controller starts repository processes at the\nsame priority as itself in some cases, and does not take\naccount of the values set in the qmproc.ini file.\n\nAPAR IC57420 - Repository manager restart following failure causes cluster\ncache corruption in some circumstances.\nIf a repository manager abends while a queue manager is under a\nheavy load of cluster-intensive operations, in some\ncircumstances the repository manager that is restarted can\ndamage the cluster cache in the CPU in which it\nis running. This can prevent further cluster operations in that\nCPU and cause WMQ processes to loop indefinitely. This release\nchanges the repository startup to prevent this from happening.\n\nAPAR IC57432 - OSS applications that attempt to perform MQI operations from\nforked processes encounter errors.\nIf an oss WMQ application forks a child process, that child\nprocess will encounter errors if it attempts to perform MQI\noperations. Some operations may succeed, but will result\nin the generation of FDC files.\n\nAPAR IC57488 - MQMC channel menu display display error after channel is\ndeleted.\nIf a channel is deleted while the channel menu in MQMC\nis displayed, refreshing the channel menu produces the\nerror: \"Unknown error received from server. Error number\nreturned is 1\" and will not correctly display the channel\nlist without restarting MQMC.\n\nAPAR IC57501 - unthreaded sender channels to remote destinations with\nsignificant network latency may fail to start with timeout\nerrors.\n\nAPAR IC57524 - Applications launched locally from remote nodes cannot access\nsome of the queue manager shared memory files due to default\nsecurity on those files.\n\nAPAR IC57627 - Handling of TMF outages to improve operational predictability.\nIf TMF disables the ability to begin new transactions\n(BEGINTRANS DISABLED), WMQ does not always react in a\npredictable or easily diagnosed manner, and applications can\nsuffer a variety of different symptoms. If TMF is stopped\nabruptly (STOP TMF, ABRUPT) queue managers can become unstable\nand require significant manual intervention to stop and restart.\nRefer to item 18 in \"Known Limitations, Problems and\nWorkarounds\" later in this README for more information.\n\nAPAR IC57712 - altmqfls --qsize with more than 100 messages on queue fails.\nWhen a altmqfls --qsize is performed with more the 100 MQ\nmessages in the queue the processing fails.\n\nAPAR IC57719 - FDCs from MQOPEN when an error exists in alias queue manager\nresolution path. If a queue resolution path includes a queue\nmanager alias, and the target of the alias does not exist,\nthis will produce an FDC, rather than just failing the\nMQOPEN as would be expected.\n\nAPAR IC57744 - CPU goes busy when stopping a threaded SSL receiver channel\nusing MODE(TERMINATE).\nIf a stop channel mode(terminate) is used to stop an SSL\nreceiver channel that is running in a threaded MCA, the CPU\nwhere the MCA is running in begin using large amounts of CPU\ntime (95% range). This is due to a problem in the threads\nlibrary.\n\nAPAR IC57876 - Very infrequently, messages put via threaded LQMAs can in some\ncircumstances contain erroneous CCSID information. This has\nbeen observed to cause conversion errors if the message is\ndestined for a channel that has the CONVERT(YES) set.\nUnthreaded LQMAs do not suffer from this problem.\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nalso released with V5.3.1.4:\n\n993 - Due to the way that default file security was used, file security for\ncertain shared memory files used by the queue manager (SZ***) may\n\ninadvertently change in a way that prevents applications not in\nthe mqm group from issuing MQCONN. File permissions were rationalised\nin this release to reflect those used for other shared memory files.\n1458 - Resolve Channel command generates FFSTs.\nWhen resolving In-Doubt channels, FFSTs were generated by the Channel\nServer and the MCA. Although the channels were successfully resolved,\nthe In-Doubt status in a DIS CHS query was not correctly updated.\nWhen resolving In-Doubt channels using the COMMIT option the following\nerror message was displayed \"AMQ8101: WebSphere MQ error (7E0) has\noccurred.\"\n1493 - The validation of the qmproc.ini file does not report the error case\nwhere multiple ChannelsNameMatch entries are specified ChlRule1.\n1498 - Instmqm does not support installation of the product on\nIntegrity NonStop BladeSystem platforms.\n1507 - Some Execution controller messages were missing \"Action\" descriptions\nwhen reported in the error log.\n1517 - In the qmproc.ini file, the AppRule4-SubvolMatch argument was not\nworking\n1522 - Communications Component Function ids and probes are incorrect. This\nresulted in misleading or missing information in trace files generated\nfor support purposes.\n1546 - MQBACK operation incorrectly reports error during broker operations\n1549 - Channel Server doesn't shutdown after takeover.\nIf the Primary Channel Server process is prematurely ended, for\nexample by a CPU crash, the Backup Channel Server process becomes the\nnew Primary process. Subsequent attempts to use endmqm will hang\nbecause the new Primary Channel Server process will not end.\n\n\nThe following documentation APARs are addressed by the V5.3.1.4 readme:\n\nAPAR IC55404 - REFRESH QMGR PCF command is not documented in the Programmable\n\ncommand formats manual.\n\nAlso - please check the \"Limitations\" and \"Known Problems and Workarounds\"\nsections later on in this readme for updates.\n\nThe following APAR fixes were released in V5.3.1.3:\n\nAPAR IC54305 - The HP TNS (non-native) C compiler generates Warning 86 when\ncompiling MQI applications\nAPAR IC55501 - The altmqfls command does not return the correct completion\nstatus; it always returns success\nAPAR IC55719 - Non-native MQINQ binding does not deal with some null pointer\nparameters correctly\nAPAR IC55977 - Channel retry does not obey SHORTTMR interval accurately enough\nAPAR IC55990 - Trigger data changes not being acted upon if they were made\nwhile the queue was open, leading to incorrect triggering\nbehavior\nAPAR IC56277 - Command Server can loop with INQUIRE QS command with a single\nparameter\nAPAR IC56278 - A remote RUNMQSC DIS QS command always times out\nAPAR IC56309 - MCAs do not disconnect from some shared memory when ending,\nwhich causes a slow memory leak, and under some conditions an\nabend\nAPAR IC56458 - Channel Server loops after installing V5.3.1.2 due to corrupt\ndata on SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ\nAPAR IC56493 - Cannot use \"qualified\" hometerm device names with V5.3.1.2\nAPAR IC56503 - Channel Server and MCA can deadlock after repeated STOP CHANNEL\nMODE(FORCE) or MODE(TERMINATE) commands\nAPAR IC56536 - Unthreaded responder channels don't de-register from the EC when\nan error occurs during or before channel negotiation. For\nexample, bad initial data will cause this. Unthreaded MCAs\nbuild up and eventually reach the maximum which prevents further\nchannel starts\nAPAR IC56681 - C++ unthreaded Tandem-Float SRLs have undefined references\n\nAPAR IC56834 - endmqm -p can sometimes leave MCA processes running\n\nThe following fixes discovered during IBM's development and testing work were\nreleased with V5.3.1.3:\n\n663 - Guardian command line utility return status is not the same as the OSS\nutilities return status\n1402 - Add additional tracing when testing for inconsistencies in processing\na channel start in the Channel Server\n1416 - Ensure that the Channel Server can support the maximum BATCHSZ of 2000\n1446 - Pub \/ Sub command line utilities do not behave well if no broker has run\nsince the queue manager was created\n1470 - EC abends attempting to start a non-executable REPMAN\n1474 - Pub \/ Sub broker process handling corrections for the EC\n1476 - The EC checkpoints the number of threads running in agents incorrectly\n1477 - Enhancement to ecasvc utility: the creation date\/time of LQMAs, MCAs,\nand REPMEN are now displayed\n1487 - Enhancement to ecasvc utility: changed the display of Agent attributes\nto use the \"real\" qmproc.ini attribute names.

The following versions were verified by IBM with this\nrelease of WMQ:\n\nACI Communication Services for Advanced Networking (ICE)\n- v4r1 on both HP Integrity NonStop Server and S-Series systems\n\nHP SNAX\n- T9096H01 on HP Integrity NonStop Server (H-Series) systems\n\nIf you use the WebSphere MQ V5.3 classes for Java and JMS for HP NonStop Server\nyou will need to install HP NonStop Server for Java Version 1.4.2 or later.\nThe Java.pdf supplemental document in the <install_path>\/opt\/mqm\/READMES\/en_US\ndirectory has been updated in this release. Java\/JMS users should review the \nupdated document.\n\nUpgrading to V5.3.1.12\n---------------------\n\nFor systems running H Series operating systems, you may upgrade\nany prior service level of WebSphere MQ V5.3.1.x for HP NonStop Server to\nV5.3.1.12 level using this release. For NonStop BladeSystem running J series\noperating systems, you may upgrade from version V5.3.1.4 only, since V5.3.1.4\nis the earliest supported version on J series. If you need to perform a full\ninstallation on a J series system from the original installation media, see the\nsection later in this readme file for instructions.\n\nThe installation tool, svcmqm, is used to upgrade existing installations\nto this level. Additionally, the placed files for any prior level of V5.3.1\ncan be overlaid with the new files from V5.3.1.12 and then instmqm can be used\nto create new installations at the updated V5.3.1.12 level.\n\nYou must end all queue managers and applications in an installation if you\nwant to upgrade that installation to V5.3.1.12.\n\nYou do not need to re-create any queue managers to upgrade to V5.3.1.12.\nExisting queue managers (at any V5.3.1.x service level) will work with\nV5.3.1.12 once an installation has been properly upgraded.\n\nIf you use SSL channels, and are upgrading from WMQ V5.3.1, you must perform\na small reconfiguration of the Certificate store before running any SSL\nchannels after you have upgraded. The steps that are required are described\nbelow in the Post-Installation section. If you do not perform this\nreconfiguration, SSL channels in the upgraded V5.3.1.12 installation will\nfail with the log messages similar to the following:\n\nFor sender channels:\n\n09\/29\/07 08:52:43 Process(0,483 $Z8206) User(MQM.ABAKASH) Program(amqrmppa)\nAMQ9621: Error on call to SSL function ignored on channel\n'ALICE_BOB_SDRC_0000'.\n\nEXPLANATION:\nAn error indicating a software problem was returned from a function which is\nused to provide SSL support.

However, \nIBM strongly recommends that if you are upgrading from a release prior to \n5.3.1.7, you review the impact of APARs IC67057 and IC68569 that were fixed in\nthe V5.3.1.7 release. Please also note internal defect 4158 that is fixed in \nV5.3.1.11. The IC67057, IC68569 and internal defect 4158 fixes will not be \neffective in non-native applications unless the applications are relinked \nusing the HP BIND utility. \n\nb) If upgrading from V5.3.1.4 or earlier releases (including patch releases) :\n\nYou MUST use the HP BIND utility to relink any non-native applications prior\nto using them with V5.3.1.12. If an application is not re-bound with the \nV5.3.1.12 WMQ product, MQCONN API calls will fail with a MQRC 2059 and the \nWMQ EC process will output an FDC when the MQI incompatibility is detected, \nas follows:\n\nProbe Id :- EC075003\nComponent :- ecaIsECup\nComment1 :- Application MQ API not compatible, relink application\nComment2 :- <process cpu,pid process name>\nComment3 :- <application executable name>\n\nInstallation from Electronic Software Download H or J Series based systems\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThese instructions apply to installing WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server,\nVersion 5.3.1.12, from the package downloaded from IBM. Please note the\nadditional restrictions for upgrading J Series systems to this version.\n\nUse svcmqm to update an existing installation from the V5.3.1.12 placed files.\n\n1. Unzip the fixpack distribution package - wmq53.1.12.tar.zip.\nThe fixpack distribution package contains the following files:\n\nreadme_wmq_5.3.1.12 - this README\nwmq53.1.12_H07.tar.Z - H-Series H06 Package\n\n2. Identify the correct fixpack package to install:\n\nFor H-Series (H06) or J-Series systems (J06) use: wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z\n\n3. Upload the compressed fixpack archive to the OSS file system in binary mode.\nYou may wish to store the compressed archive, and the expanded contents\nin a location where you archive software distributions from IBM.\nIf you do this, you should store the compressed archive in a directory\nthat identifies the version of the software it contains,\nfor example, \"V53112\".\n\nmkdir -p \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\nupload (in binary mode) the correct compressed tarfile to this directory\n\n4. Extract the fixpack compressed tarfile using commands similar to:\n\ncd \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\nuncompress wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z\n\ntar xvof wmq53.1.12_H06.tar\n\n5. Locate your WMQ V5.3.1.x installation(s). The service installation procedure\nrequires the full OSS path names of the opt\/mqm and var\/mqm directories for\neach WMQ installation to which the fixpack will be installed.\n\n6. Logon to OSS using the WMQ installation owner's userid\n\n7. End all Queue Managers defined in the WMQ Installation.\nendmqm <qmgr name>\n\nEnsure all Queue Managers defined in the WMQ installation\nare ended.\ndspmq\n\nEnsure that the WMQ installation is at a suitable V5.3.1 level.\nmqver -V\nSee later notes concerning version requirements for NonStop BladeSystem\ninstallation.\n\n8. End any non-Pathway listeners for Queue Managers defined in the\nWQM installation:\nendmqlsr -m <qmgr name>\n\n9. Verify that no files in the Guardian subvolumes of the installation to\nbe updated are open. The installation cannot proceed safely unless all\nfiles in these subvolumes are closed. Use the TACL command 'FUP LISTOPENS'\nfor the files in all three subvolumes - an absence of output indicates\nthat no files are open. If files are shown to be open, use the output\nfrom the command to identify processes that are holding files open.\n\n\n10. Backup your WMQ Installation; the fixpack cannot be uninstalled.\ninstmqm -b can be used to back up an installation. Please refer\nto the readme file included with release WMQ V5.3.1.\n\n11. Install the fixpack by running the supplied service tool (svcmqm).\nSvcmqm requires the location of the OSS var tree as well\nas the OSS opt tree. These locations can be supplied automatically by\nrunning svcmqm in an OSS shell where the environment variables for the\nWMQ installation being updated have been established (typically by\nsourcing \"wmqprofile\"). If this is the case, svcmqm does not require the\n-i and -v parameters. \n\nFor example:\ncd \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\nopt\/mqm\/bin\/svcmqm -s \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\/opt\/mqm\n\nIf the environment variables for the WMQ installation are not established in \nthe environment of svcmqm or if you want to update a WMQ installation other\nthan the one that your current WMQ environment variable points to, then \nthe locations of the OSS opt and var trees must be supplied explicitly using\nthe svcmqm command line parameters -i and -v.\n\nFor example:\n\ncd \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\nopt\/mqm\/bin\/svcmqm -s \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\/opt\/mqm\n-i \/wmq1\/opt\/mqm\n-v \/wmq1\/var\/mqm\n\nsvcmqm will prompt to confirm the location of the OSS opt tree for the\ninstallation to be updated.\nType \"yes\" to proceed.\n\nSvcmqm will then update the installation. The current WMQCSTM file for\nthe installation will be renamed to BWMQCSTM as a backup copy, before it\nis regenerated. Note that any changes to the WMQCSTM file you have made\nwill not be copied to the new WMQCSTM file, however they will be preserved\nin the backup copy made before the WMQCSTM file was regenerated.\n\n12. Repeat Steps 5-11 for any other WMQ installations that you want to update\nwith this fixpack.\n\n13. You can install this fixpack in the WMQ placed installation files so that\nany future WMQ product installations will include the fixpack updates.\n\nTo do this, locate your WMQ placed installation filetree containing the\nopt directory, make this your current working directory (use 'cd') and\nthen unpack the contents of the tar archive for this fixpack over the placed\nfile tree. For example, if the placed files are located in the default\nlocation \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V531, for a H-Series system:\n\ncd \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V531\ntar xvof \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V5319\/wmq53.1.12_H06.tar\n\nInitial Installation on a NonStop BladeSystem\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThese instructions apply to installing WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server on\na NonStop BladeSystem using the original installation media, in conjunction\nwith the 5.3.1.12 package downloaded from IBM. NonStop BladeSystem platforms\nare not supported prior to V5.3.1.4, and a \"from scratch\" installation requires\neither V5.3.1.4 or later files to be overlaid on a set of placed files\nfrom the base product media prior to performing the installation.\nYou do NOT need to perform these steps if you have already installed V5.3.1.4\non your NonStop BladeSystem. In this case, follow the standard installation\nsteps earlier in this readme file.\n\n1. Place the files for the Refresh Pack 1 (5.3.1.0) version of WebSphere MQ\n\nfor HP NonStop Server on the target system. Refer to the \"File Placement\"\nsection in Chapter 3 of the \"WebSphere MQ for NonStop Server Quick\nBeginnings\" guide. Pages 11-13 describes how to place the files.\nDo not attempt to install the placed files using the instmqm script\nthat was provided with V5.3.1.0 at this time. The V5.3.1.0 version of\ninstmqm does not support installation on NonStop BladeSystem.\n\n2. Unzip the 5.3.1.12 fixpack distribution package - wmq53.1.12.tar.zip.\nThe fixpack distribution package contains the following files:\n\nreadme_wmq_5.3.1.12 This README\nwmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z H-Series H06 Package\n\n3. This installation requires the wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z package.\nLocate the WMQ placed installation filetree containing the opt directory\nprepared in step 1 above, and upload the wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z fixpack\narchive to this location in binary mode.\n\n4. Extract the fixpack compressed tarfile using commands similar to:\n\ncd \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\nuncompress wmq53.1.12_H06.tar.Z\n\n5. Unpack the contents of the extracted tar archive for this FixPack over the\nplaced file tree. For example, if the placed files are located in the default\nlocation \/usr\/ibm\/wmq:\n\ncd \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\ntar xvof \/usr\/ibm\/wmq\/V53112\/wmq53.1.12_H06.tar\n\n6. Use the extracted instmqm script in this FixPack to install the product\nusing the updated installation file tree and the instructions in Chapter 3\nof \"WebSphere MQ for NonStop Server Quick Beginnings\" guide, pages 13-29.\nBefore beginning, review the list of changes to Chapter 3 detailed in the\n\"Documentation Updates\" section at the end of this README file. Note also\nthat the list of installed files displayed will differ from those shown in the\nexamples in the manual.\n\nPost-Installation\n-----------------\nIf upgrading from WMQ V5.3.1, read the following post-installation instructions:\n\nNon-Native TNS Applications:\n\nRe-BIND any non-native (TNS) applications. See \"Upgrading to V5.3.1.12\" above \nfor more information.\n\nRe-binding non-native (TNS) is REQUIRED if upgrading from V5.3.1.4 or earlier\nreleases but is RECOMMENDED if upgrading from V5.3.1.5 or later fixpack for \nincorporation of APARs IC67057, IC68569 and internal defect 4158. \n\nIf you use SSL channels and have not already installed V5.3.1.1:\n\nEdit the SSL certificate store, cert.pem and move all the CA certificates\nto a new file, trust.pem, stored in the same directory as cert.pem. The\nonly items that should remain in cert.pem are the queue manager's personal\ncertificate, and the queue manager's private key. These two items should\nbe located at the start of the cert.pem file. All other certificates\n(intermediate and root CAs) must be moved to trust.pem. The trust.pem file\nmust be in the same directory as cert.pem, as configured in the queue\nmanager's SSLKEYR attribute.\n\nUpdate the copy of the entropy daemon program that you run for SSL channels\non the system with the new version (...opt\/mqm\/ssl\/amqjkdm0).\n\nEnable new support for Danish CCSID 65024:\n\nCustomers who wish to enable the new support for Danish CCSID 65024\nshould do the following to install the revised ccsid.tbl file:\n\nIssue the following commands on OSS:\n\n1. Logon to OSS using the WMQ installation owner's userid\n2. End all Queue Managers defined in the WMQ Installation.\nendmqm <qmgr name>\n3. Source in the installation's wmqprofile\n. $MQNSKVARPATH\/wmqprofile\n4. cp -p $MQNSKOPTPATH\/samp\/ccsid.tbl $MQNSKVARPATH\/conv\/table\/\n5. Start queue managers\n\nGuardian C++ DLLs:\n\nEnsure that the WMQ Guardian C++ DLLs are 'executable' by using \"FUP ALTER\"\nto set their FILECODE to 800 (for H-Series or J-Series). Use commands similar \nto the following:\n\n1. Logon to TACL using the WMQ installation owner's userid\n\n2. OBEY your WMQ Installation's WMQCSTM file\n3. VOLUME [#param MQNSKOPTPATH^LIB^G]\n4. FUP ALTER IMQI2,CODE 800\n5. FUP ALTER IMQI2T,CODE 800\n6. FUP ALTER IMQI3,CODE 800\n7. FUP ALTER IMQI3T,CODE 800\n8. Logoff\n\nGuardian Subvolume File Permissions\n\nThe WMQ Guardian Installation Subvolume and all WMQ Guardian Queue\nManager Subvolumes must accessible to both MQM group members\nand to users that run WMQ application programs.\n\nEnsure that:\n\nAll members of the MQM security group have read, write, execute\nand purge permission to these subvolumes.\n\nAll users that run WMQ application programs, have read, write\nand execute permission to these subvolumes\n\nRestart Queue Managers:\n\nRestart the queue managers for the installation you have\nupdated with this fixpack.\n\nUNINSTALLATION INFORMATION\n==========================\n\nThis fixpack cannot be automatically uninstalled if a problem occurs\nduring the update of an installation using svcmqm.\n\nYou should use the instmqm -b option to create a backup of an\ninstallation before applying the service. If a problem occurs\nor you need to reverse the upgrade at a later date, use the\ninstmqm -x option to restore a backup of the installation at the\nprior service level.\n\nKNOWN LIMITATIONS, PROBLEMS AND WORKAROUNDS\n===========================================\n\nThis section details known limitation, problems, and workarounds for\nWebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server, Version 5.3.1.12.\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\n1. The current implementation of Publish \/ Subscribe is restricted to run\nwithin a single CPU. The control program and all \"worker\" programs run in\nthe CPU that was used to run the 'strmqbrk' command.\nThe Publish\/Subscribe broker does not automatically recover in the event\nof CPU failures.\n\n2. The current memory management implementation in the Queue Server limits\nthe total amount of non-persistent message data that can be stored on all\nthe queues hosted by a single Queue Server to less than 1Gb. The limit of\nnon-persistent message data on a single queue can not exceed approximately\n1Gb therefore, even if a single Queue Server is dedicated to that queue.\n\n3. The number of threads in threaded agent processes (LQMAs or MCAs) or in MQI\napplications, is limited to a maximum of 1000 by the limit on open depth of\nthe HP TMF T-file.\n\n4. API exits are not supported for non-native (TNS) applications. Any other\nexit code for non-native applications must be statically bound with the\nTNS application.\n\n5. Cluster workload exits are only supported in \"trusted\" mode. This means\nthat a separate copy of each exit will run in each CPU and exit code in\none CPU cannot communicate with exit code in another CPU using the normal\nmethods provided for these exits.\n\n6. Upgmqm will not migrate the following data from a V5.1 queue manager:\nmessages stored in Message Overflow files (typically persistent messages\nover 200,000 bytes in size) will not be migrated. If the option to\nmigrate message data was selected, the upgrade will fail. if the option\nto migrate message data was not selected, the upgrade will not be\naffected by the presence of message overflow files.\nclustering configuration data - all cluster related attributes of objects\nwill be reset to default values in the new V5.3 queue manager.\nSNA channel configuration - channels will be migrated, but several of the\nattributes values will need to be changed manually after the upgrade.\nchannel exit data - attributes in channels that relate to channel exit\nconfiguration will be reset to default values in the new V5.3 queue\nmanager.\nIn all cases where upgmqm cannot migrate data completely, a warning message\nis generated on the terminal output as well as in the log file. These can\nbe reviewed carefully after the upgrade completes for further actions that\nmay be necessary.\n\n7. Java and JMS limitations\n\nThe Java and JMS Classes do not support client connections. WebSphere MQ\nfor HP NonStop Server does not support XA transaction management, so the\nJMS XA classes are not available. For more detail, please refer to the\nJava and JMS documentation supplement, Java.pdf.\n\n8. Control commands in Guardian (TACL) environment do not obey the RUN option\n\"NAME\" as expected\n\nA Guardian control command starts an OSS process to run the actual\ncontrol command - and waits for it to complete. When the NAME option is\nused, the Guardian control command process uses the requested name, but\nthe OSS process cannot and is instead named by NonStop OS.\n\nIf the Guardian control command is prematurely stopped by the operator\n(using the TACL STOP command for example) the OSS process running the\nactual control command may continue to run. The OSS process may need to be\nstopped separately and in addition to the Guardian process.\n\n9. Trace doesn't end automatically after a queue manager restart\n(APAR IC53352) and trace changes do not take effect immediately\n\nIf trace is active and a queue manager is restarted, the trace settings\nshould be reset to not trace any more. Instead, the queue manager\ncontinues tracing using the same options as before it was restarted.\nThe workaround is to disable trace using endmqtrc before ending, or while\nthe queue manager is ended.\n\nAlso, changes to trace settings do not always take effect immediately\nafter the command is issued. For example, it could be several MQI calls\nlater that the change takes effect. The maximum delay between making a\ntrace settings change and the change taking effect would be until the end\nof the queue manager connection, or the ending of a channel.\n\n10. Some EMS events generated to default collector despite an alternate\ncollector being configured (APAR IC53005)\n\nAn EMS event message \"FFST record created\" is generated using the OSS\nsyslog() facility whenever an FDC is raised by a queue manager. This\nEMS event cannot be disabled, and goes to the default collector $0. For\nOSS processes, an alternate collector process can be specified by\nincluding an environment variable in the context of these processes\nas in the following example:\n\nexport EMS_COLLECTOR=\\$ALT\n\nGuardian processes always use the default collector because HP do not\nprovide the ability to modify the collector in the Guardian environment.\nHP is investigating if a change is possible. No fix for this problem\nhas yet been identified.\n\n11. The use of SMF (virtual) disks with WMQ is not supported on Release\nVersion Updates prior to H06.26 and J06.15 because of restrictions\nimposed by the OSS file system. For more details, please refer to the\nHP NonStop Storage Management Foundation User's Guide Page 2-12.\n\n12. The maximum channel batch size that can be configured (BATCHSZ attribute)\nis 2000. If you need to run channels with batch sizes greater than 680\nyou must increase the maximum message length attribute of the\nSYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ to 60000.\n\ne.g. from RUNMQSC - ALTER QL (SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ) MAXMSGL (60000)\n\n13. The SYSTEM.CHANNEL.SYNCQ is a critical system queue for operation of\nthe queue manager and should not be altered to disable MQGET or MQPUT\noperations, or to reduce the maximum message size or maximum depth\nattributes from their defaults.\n\n14. Currently, the cluster transmission queue (SYSTEM.CLUSTER.TRANSMIT.QUEUE)\ncannot be moved to an alternative Queue Server because it is constantly\nopen by several internal components. The following procedure (which\nrequires a \"quiet\" queue manager, and a queue manager restart) can be\nused to achieve this reconfiguration. Do not use this procedure on a\nqueue manager that is running in production. Read and understand the\nprocedure carefully first since it includes actions that cause\ninternal errors to be generated in the queue manager.\n\n1\/ Rename the OSS repository executable (opt\/mqm\/bin directory)\nmv amqrrmfa amqrrmfax \n2\/ From OSS enter 'ps -f | grep amqrrmfa | grep X '\nwhere X is the Queue Manager name.\n3\/ kill -9 those processes returned from step 2\nAt this point the EC will start continuously generating FDCs and\nlog messages as it attempts to, and fails, to restart the repository\nservers that were stopped. Perform the remaining steps in this\nprocedure without delay to avoid problems with excessive logging\nsuch as disk full conditions.\n4. Verify the processes are stopped\nFrom OSS enter 'ps -f | grep amqrrmfa | grep X '\nWhere X is the Queue Manager name\n5. Issue the altmqfls --server command to move the cluster transmission\nqueue to an alternate queue server\n6. Issue dspmqfls to verify the alternate server assignment\n7. Rename the OSS repository executable back to the expected name\nmv amqrrmfax amqrrmfa\n8. End the queue manager using preemptive shutdown. The EC will generate\nFDCs ending because of the earlier attempts to start a repository\nmanager while the executable was renamed. There will be FDCs and\nEC Primary process failover\n\nComponent :- xcsExecProgram\nProbe Description :- AMQ6025: Program not found\nComment1 :- No such file or directory\nComment2 :- \/opt\/mqm\/bin\/amqrrmfa\n...\nAMQ8846: MQ NonStop Server takeover initiated\nAMQ8813: EC has started takeover processing\nAMQ8814: EC has completed takeover processing\n...\nThe EC may have to be manually TACL stopped if quiesce or immediate\nend is used thus the need for the preemptive shutdown\nendmqm -p <qmgr name>\n9.

In Guardian\/TACL environments, support for some WMQ command-line programs\nhas been deprecated for WMQ Fixpack 5.3.1.3 and later.\n\nThe affected command-line programs are:\n\namqoamd\namqrdbgm\namqrfdm\ncrtmqcvx\nendmqlsr\nrunmqchi\nrunmqchl\nrunmqdlq\nrunmqlsr\nrunmqtrm\n\nThese programs will continue to function for now, however their use in\nGuardian\/TACL environments is discouraged. Support for these programs\nin Guardian\/TACL environments may be withdrawn completely in a future\nWMQ 5.3 release\/fixpack.\n\nIBM recommends that customers use the OSS version of these programs instead.\n\nCustomers who want to route output from WMQ OSS tools to VHS or other Guardian\ncollectors should use the OSSTTY utility. OSSTTY is a standard utility\nprovided by OSS and is described in the HP publication \"Open System Services\nManagement and Operations Guide\".\n\nNote: See Item 3. in \"Known problems and workarounds\" for a description of\nrestrictions when using the MQ Broker administration commands in the\nGuardian\/TACL environment.\n\n16. Do not use WebSphere MQ with a $CMON process that alters attributes of WMQ\nprocesses (for example the processor, priority, process name or program\nfile name) when they are started. This is not a supported environment since\nthere are components in WMQ that rely on these attributes being set as\nspecified by WMQ for their correct operation.\n\n17. Support for forked processes\n\nMQI Support from forked processes in OSS is subject to the following\nrestrictions:\n1. If forking is used, MQI operations can be performed only from child\nprocesses. Using MQI verbs from a parent process that forks child\nprocesses is not supported and will result in unpredictable\nbehavior.\n\n2. Use of the MQI from forked processes where the parent or child is\nthreaded is not supported.\n\n18. TMF Outage handling\n\nTMF outage handling was significantly improved with V5.3.1.4, however there\nis still a limitation in V5.3.1.6 and later to be aware of:\n\n1. If a STOP TMF, ABRUPT command is issued, TMF marks all open audited\nfiles as corrupt and the queue manager cannot perform further\nprocessing until this condition is rectified by restarting TMF.\nIn this state, the queue manager will freeze further operation, and log\nthe condition in the queue manager log file every 10 seconds for a\nmaximum of 50 attempts. Whether or not TMF is restored within this\ntimeframe, the WMQ queue manager should be restarted to reduce the risk\nof any undetected damage persisting.\n\n19. Triggering HP NSS non-C Guardian applications\n\nThe MQ default Trigger Monitor process, runmqtrm, at present cannot\ndirectly trigger the following application types:\n\nGuardian TACL scripts or macro file\nCOBOL application\nTAL application\nAn OSS script file (wmqtrig) provides indirect support for these\nfiles types. To use this script, the PROCESS definition APPLTYPE should\nbe set to UNIX, and the APPLICID should refer to the script as in\nthe following examples:\n\nFor a TACL script called \"trigmacf\":\nAPPLICID('\/opt\/mqm\/bin\/wmqtrig -c \\$data06.fp4psamp.trigmacf')\nAPPLTYPE(UNIX)\n\nFor a COBOL or TAL application called \"mqsecha\":\nAPPLICID('\/opt\/mqm\/bin\/wmqtrig -p \/G\/data06\/fp4psamp\/mqsecha')\nAPPLTYPE(UNIX)\n\n\nNotes:\n1. TACL scripts use the wmqtrig script with a \"-c\" option.\nThe -c option should use the Guardian representation for file name\nof the TACL script file, with the special character ($) escaped,\nfor example:\n\n\\$data06.fp4psamp.trigmacf\n\n2. COBOL and TAL applications use the wmqtrig script with a \"-p\" option.\nThe -p option must use the OSS representation for the file name of\nthe application, for example:\n\n\/G\/data06\/fp4psamp\/mqsecha\n\n3. C applications can be triggered directly by specifying\n\nAPPLICID('$DATA06.FP4PSAMP.MQSECHA')\nAPPLTYPE(NSK)\n\nTo trigger a PIC application using the WMQ Pathway MQS-TRIGMON00\nserverclass, a DEFINE is required:\n\n=_RLD_LIB_PATH,CLASS SEARCH,SUBVOL0 <Guardian MQ binary Volume.Subvolume>\n\nFor example:\nALTER MQS-TRIGMON00,\nDEFINE =_RLD_LIB_PATH,CLASS SEARCH,SUBVOL0 $DATA06.FP4PBIN\n\n4. If the \"-p\" option is used, gtacl passes the complete MQTMC2 structure\ntext (which is 560 bytes) to the application being triggered, whereas if\nthe \"-c\" option is used, limitations in TACL will cause the triggered \napplication to receive 520 bytes only.\nApplications intended to be triggered using -p option must handle the \ncomplete 560 character startup character string.\nThis can cause problems, particularly with COBOL applications;\nSince a COBOL GETSTARTUPTEXT call can process only 529 characters,\ntriggering a COBOL application with the -p option (560 character startup\nstring) can result in a memory overwrite and application abend.\nIn this case, the -c option should be used instead of the -p option.\"\n\n20. Maximum numnber of LQMA processes\n\nThe maximum number of LQMA processes per queue manager is 1417. Attempts to\nconfigure a MaxUnthreadedAgents value of 1418 or greater in the qmproc.ini file\nwill result in FDCs when the queue manager attempts to start the 1418th LQMA.\n\n21. Limitation on ProcessNameRoot values in qmproc.ini file\n\nThe ProcessNameRoot value used in the qmproc.ini file for the MCA, LQMA and \nRepositoryManager stanzas must be unique across all queue managers in all\ninstallations on the system. If the values are not unique, two queue \nmanagers attempting to create a new process name at the same time may attempt\nto use the same sequence of names, resulting in heavy load on the OSS\nnameserver and\/or FDCs with probes EC062000 from eclStartMCA or EC065000 from\neclStartLQMA. This may result in the queue manager becoming unresponsive.\n\n22. BIND\/REPLACE Warning 9\n\nThe use of BIND\/REPLACE when re-binding non-native (TNS) applications with \nthe latest WMQ TNS Library is supported, however, when using this command, \nyou may encounter many Bind 'warning 9' messages. These warnings are safe to\nignore, as the changes made in the MQMTNS library are completely contained\nwithin that library and there is no external affect on an application that\nwould link with that library. Please refer to document \nID mmr_ns-4.0.6050052.2565545 in KBNS which has been updated by HP to include\nthis information. \n\n23. PING CHANNEL uses the =TCPIP^PROCESS^NAME DEFINE as opposed to the \nvalue set in the qmproc.ini file.\n\nIf the TCPIP^PROCESS^NAME DEFINE is invalid, attempts to issue a \nPING CHANNEL request will fail with the following message -\n\":AMQ9212: A TCP\/IP socket could not be allocated.\"\n\n24. Using multiple cluster receiver channels for a queue manager can cause the \nmaster and slave repository managers to get out of sync in some configurations, \nthis results in FFSTs from rrmHPNSSGetMetaPacket with Comment1 field \n\"Meta data mis-match Expected: metalen=xx\".\nThe root cause of this problem has not been identified definitively, but it is\nrecommended that cluster configurations do not use multiple cluster receiver \nchannels for the same cluster on a given queue manager.\n\n25. Format 2 Queue and Queue overflow files are not supported\n\nIf an attempt is made to use altmqfls to change extent size or max extents of \na Queue or Queue overflow file such that the new file size would require a\nformat 2 file, the attempt will fail and an FDC file containing the following\n\nProbe Id :- XC066050 \nComponent :- xgcDupPartFile \n... \nMajor Errorcode :- xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_RC \nMinor Errorcode :- krcE_UNEXPECTED_ERROR \nProbe Description :- AMQ6118: An internal WMQ error has occurred \n(20800893) \n...\nArith1 :- 545261715 20800893 \n\n26. RUNMQSC DISPLAY QSTATUS(*) TYPE(HANDLE) ALL can return only 500 handles\n\nThe current implementation of DISPLAY QSTATUS can handle only 500 queue\nhandles. In prior releases, executing the command in a scenario where there\nwere more than 500 handles resulted in an error return and large numbers of \nFFSTs (see internal defect 2230 earlier in this readme). These errors are the\nresult of a design limitation with the DISPLAY QSTATUS implementation. \nThe processing of the command has been modified to handle the scenario cleanly\nand return only the first 500 handles retrieved, as supported by the design.\n\nKnown problems and workarounds\n------------------------------\n1. FDCs from Component xcsDisplayMessage reporting xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_SYSTEM_RC\n\nOn RVUs H06.06 and later:\n\nThese FDCs occur frequently on queue manager shutdown, and at times during\nqueue manager start, from processes that write to the queue manager log\nfiles at these times, typically the cluster repository cache manager\n(amqrrmfa) and the EC (MQECSVR). No functional problem is caused by these\nFDCs, except that the queue manager log file misses some log messages\nduring queue manager shutdown. The FDCs report an unexpected return code\nfrom the HP lseek() function. An example of an FDC demonstrating this\nproblem follows:\n\nProbe Id :- XC022011\nComponent :- xcsDisplayMessage\nProgram Name :- $DATA06.RP1PBIN.MQECSVR\nMajor Errorcode :- xecF_E_UNEXPECTED_SYSTEM_RC\n\nMQM Function Stack\nnspPrimary\neclShutdownOK\nxcsDisplayMessageForSubpool\nxcsDisplayMessage\nxcsFFST\n\n6fffe660 000011FA ....\n6fffe670 2F686F6D 652F726F 622F4D51 \/home\/test\/MQ\n6fffe680 352E332F 5250312F 50726F64 2F776D71 5.3\/RP1\/Prod\/wmq\n6fffe690 2F766172 2F6D716D 2F716D67 72732F51 \/var\/mqm\/qmgrs\/Q\n6fffe6a0 4D312F65 72726F72 732F414D 51455252 M1\/errors\/AMQERR\n6fffe6b0 30312E4C 4F47 01.LOG\n\nThis problem is fixed by the following HP SPRs\n\nT8620ACL (OSSFS) for G06 HP OS\nT8620ACM (OSSFS) for H06 HP OS\n\n2. APAR IC54594 - EC abends with non-MQM user running application from non-MQM\ndirectory.\n\nStatically-bound TNS applications that are not relinked after installing \nFixpack 5.3.1.4 have additional considerations. For these applications, \nqmproc.ini Application Rules 2 and 4 will not work if the application \nis located in a non-MQM directory.\n\n3. The Guardian control commands for the Publish \/ Subscribe broker\n(strmqbrk, endmqbrk, dspmqbrk ... etc) will not work correctly unless they\nare run in the same CPU as the broker is running in, or was last running in.\n\nPlease use the equivalent OSS commands instead of the Guardian versions, or\nensure that the Guardian Publish \/ Subscribe broker commands run in the same\nCPU as the broker was or is running in.\n\n4. Queue managers occasionally do not delete Temporary Dynamic Queues the \nwhen the last application closes them. The cause of this is unknown at present.\nThe problem is rare and unlikely to cause significant impact on queue \nmanager operation unless the queues are present in very large numbers.\nQueues orphaned in this way cannot be used by applications, and are removed\nunconditionally as a part of the normal garbage collection activity during \na queue manager restart.\n\nDOCUMENTATION UPDATES\n=====================\n\nPlease note that several supplements to the documentation have been provided\nwith fixpacks since V5.3 was originally released. These supplements have\nbeen released in Adobe Acrobat format and can found in the\nopt\/mqm\/READMES\/en_US directory of any installation as well as the original\nsoftware distribution tree (placed files). The following supplements have\nbeen released to date (the name of the file describes the content):\n\nExits.pdf\nJava.pdf\nPubsub.pdf\nSNAChannels.pdf\nSSLUpdate.pdf\nUpgmqmreadme.pdf\nSdcp.pdf\n\nAlso please note that the current published versions of the cross-platform\n(\"family\") books contain references to the IBM MQSeries V5.1 for Compaq NSK\nproduct which is the previous major version of WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop\nServer. Consequently, these references may not be accurate with respect to\nthe functional support provided by V5.3.1.\n\nWebsphere MQ Programmable Command Formats and Administration Interface\n(SC34-6060-03)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChapter 3 - PCF Commands and Responses in Groups\n\nPage 19: Add \"Refresh Queue manager\" as a supported command\n\nChapter 4 - Definitions of Programmable Command Formats\n\nPage 173: Add the following new command:\n\nRefresh Qmgr\n\nThe Refresh Qmgr (MQCMD_REFRESH_Q_MGR) command refreshes the\nExecution Controller (EC) process management rules.\n\nThis PCF is supported only on WebSphere MQ V5.3 HP NonStop Server.\n\nRequired parameters:\nNone\n\nOptional parameters:\nNone\n\nError codes\n\nThis command might return the following in the response format\nheader, in addition to the values shown on page 18.\n\nReason (MQLONG)\n\nThe value can be:\nMQRCCF_PARM_COUNT_TOO_BIG\n\nParameter count too big.\n\nWebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server Quick Beginnings (GC34-6626-00)\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChapter 1 - Planning to install WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server\n\nPage 1: the baseline release level for V5.3.1 on the HP Integrity NonStop\nServer is now H06.05.01\nPage 1: the typical approximate storage requirements are as follows:\n+ OSS files placed before installation:\nH-Series: 160Mb\n+ For each installation:\nH-Series: Guardian 220Mb, OSS 350Mb, Total 570Mb\n+ For each queue manager:\nH-Series: Guardian 9.5Mb, OSS 0.2Mb, Total 10Mb\nPages 2 & 3: please review the section \"Hardware and Software\nRequirements\" in these release notes for the details of all other updated\nrequirements\nChapter 3 - Installing WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server\n\nPage 12: Product Selection dialog. The names of the products have been\nupdated to \"WebSphere MQ V5.3.1\" and \"WebSphere MQ V5.3.1 Integrity\".\nPage 14: instmqm now includes the function of creating an automatic\nbackup archive of a successful installation, as follows:\nInstmqm has been enhanced to provide the ability to back-out an ungrade\ninstallation, and the ability to archive and restore installations\nindividually. Before instmqm starts to make changes to a system, it will\nautomatically create an archive of the current installation (OSS opt tree\nand Guardian installation subvolumes only) in the root directory\ncontaining the opt tree in OSS. If a failure occurs during installation,\nand instmqm has made changes, the user will be asked if they wish to\nrestore the installation to its original state using the archive created\nbefore changes were made. At the end of a successful installation,\ninstmqm will now automatically create a backup archive of the new\ninstallation.\n\nInstmqm also supports two new command line options to support creating\nand using backup archives independently from an installation:\n\n-b create a backup archive of the installation\n-x restore an installation from a backup archive\n\nThese options may not be combined with any other options. Both options\nrequire the user to respond to questions at the terminal.\n\nA backup archive file is an OSS pax file, created as follows:\n\n+ the Guardian PAK utility is used to create a backup of the three\nGuardian subvolumes for the installation in a file named \"WMQSAVED\"\n+ the PAK backup file is copied to the OSS opt directory of the\ninstallation that is being archived\n+ the entire OSS opt tree of the installation (which now includes\nWMQSAVED) is then archived by the OSS pax utility\n\nBackup archive files are always created in the directory that holds the\nOSS opt tree for the installation. Archive files created automatically\nby instmqm are named \"mqarchive-yymmdd-hhmmss\" where \"yymmdd\" and\n\"hhmmss\" are numeric strings of the date and time that the backup archive\nwas created - for example: \"mqarchive-061005-143606\".\n\nPage 15: instmqm has new command line options as described in these\nrelease notes for creating and restoring backup archives\nPage 17: the SnaProviderName and TcpProviderName fields of the\nQmgrDefaults stanza in the instmqm response file are used to populate\nthe proc.ini file to provide installation wide defaults for channels.\nPlease note that these fields do not get used for the default listener\nconfiguration either on the command line (runmqlsr) or in the queue\nmanager's Pathway environment. Users must manually configure the\ntransport names for all listeners.\nPage 28: in addition to the manual methods for cleaning up after a failed\ninstallation, instmqm will offer the option to restore the previous\ninstallation from a backup archive in the event of a failure while\nupgrading a V5.3 installation to V5.3.1 level. These release notes\ndescribe the additional function.\nIf an installation was initially created without SSL (selection of the\ninstallation type \"CORE\" for instmqm), the following procedure can be\nused to update the installation to include SSL components. In the\ninstructions below, <MQInstall> refers to the location of the\ninstallation that needs to be updated and <PlacedInstall> means the\nlocation of the complete set of placed files for the level of WMQ that\ncorresponds to the installation being updated. All queue managers\nmust be ended before attempting this procedure.\n1. mkdir <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\n2. chmod 775 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\n3. cp <PlacedInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/* <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\n4. chmod 775 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/amq*\"...\n5. cp <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/openssl <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/bin\n6. chmod 664 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/openssl\n7. chmod 774 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/bin\/openssl\n8. cp <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/amqjkdm0 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/bin\n9. chmod 775 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/bin\/amqjkdm0\n10. mv <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca\n<MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca_nossl\n11. mv <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca_r\n<MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca_r_nossl\n12. cp <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/amqccssl <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca\n13. cp <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/ssl\/amqccssl_r\n<MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca_r\n14. chmod 775 <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/lib\/amqcctca*\n15. The <MQInstall>\/var\/mqm\/qmgrs\/<qmgr name> directory should have an\n\nssl directory which is where you will store the certificate related\nfiles (cert.pem, trust.pem etc.)\n16. The <MQInstall>\/opt\/mqm\/samp\/ssl should exist already with the ssl\nsamples\n17. If the entropy daemon is not configured on the system this will need\nto be performed.

Therefore it is important to manually\ncreate a directory specific to each PTF, download the PTF to that new\ndirectory and then expand the archive within the new directory.\nPage 44: in step 2 of \"Running the installation script for a PTF\", the\n\nsvcmqm tool has a different command line from that documented for\n\"installCSDxx\". svcmqm takes three parameters:\nsvcmqm -i installationtree -v vartree -s servicepackage\nwhere \"installationtree\" is the full path to the location of the opt\/mqm\ndirectory of the installation to be updated\n\"vartree\" is the full path to the location of the var\/mqm\ndirectory of the installation to be updated\n\"servicepackage\" is the full path to the location of the opt\/mqm\ndirectory of the maintenance to be installed\nFor example:\nsvcmqm -i \/home\/me\/wmq\/opt\/mqm -v \/home\/me\/wmq\/var\/mqm\n-s \/home\/me\/wmqfiles\/opt\/mqm\n\nwhich will update the installation in \/home\/me\/wmq\/opt\/mqm and\n\n\/home\/me\/wmq\/var\/mqm from the maintenance package in directory tree\n\/home\/me\/wmqfiles\/opt\/mqm.\n\nIf either or both the \"-i installationtree\" and \"-v vartree\" parameters\nare omitted, svcmqm will use the current setting of the appropriate\nenvironment variable - either WMQNSKOPTPATH or WMQNSKVARPATH.\n\nWebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server System Administration Guide (SC34-6625-00)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChapter 2 - An introduction to WebSphere MQ administration\n\nPage 16: before running any control commands on OSS or NonStop OS it is\nnecessary to establish the environment variables for the session. When\nan installation is created a file called wmqprofile is also created in\nthe var\/mqm directory that will establish the environment for an OSS\nshell. Likewise, a file is also created in the NonStop OS subvolume\ncontaining the WMQ NonStop OS samples called WMQCSTM that can be used\nto set up the appropriate environment variables for a NonStop OS TACL\nsession.\nTo establish the WMQ environment for an OSS shell session:\n\n. wmqprofile\n\nTo establish the WMQ environment for a NonStop OS TACL session:\n\nobey WMQCSTM\n\nThe same steps are required before running any applications in the\nOSS or NonStop OS environment.\n\nChapter 4 - Administering local WebSphere MQ objects\n\n\nPage 48: when creating a Process definition, the default value for\nthe APPLTYPE attribute is \"NSK\" (indicating a Guardian program)\nChapter 7 - WebSphere MQ for HP NonStop Server architecture\n\nPage 80: the MQSC command to reload the process management rules is\nREFRESH QMGR TYPE(NSPROC) and not RESET QMGR TYPE(NSPROC)\nChapter 8 - Managing scalability, performance, availability and data\nintegrity\n\nPage 104: the last paragraph of the OpenTMF section should be reworded\nas follows:\nNo special administrative actions are required for this use of TMF.\nWebSphere MQ uses and manages it automatically. You must ensure that\nthe RMOPENPERCPU and BRANCHESPERRM configuration parameters of TMF are\nset to appropriate values for your configuration. Please see Chapter 12\n\nTransactional Support - Configuring TMF for WebSphere MQ for\ninformation on how to calculate the correct values.

See Chapter 18 - The control\ncommands for a description of how to use this parameter with crtmqm.\nPage 120: the section describing the ARGLIST attribute of a TCP\/IP\nListener should also mention the use of the optional -u parameter to\nconfigure channels started by the listener as unthreaded processes.\nThe default is to run incoming channels as threads in an MCA process.\nPage 130: the MQSC command to reload the process management rules is\nREFRESH QMGR TYPE(NSPROC) and not RESET QMGR TYPE(NSPROC)\nPage 133: Figure 23 remove :\nOAM Manager stanza #\nOamManager:\nPage 136: the Exit properties section should state that the only\n\nsupported way of configuring and running a Cluster Workload (CLWL) Exit\nfor HP NonStop Server is in FAST mode. The CLWLMode setting in qm.ini\nis required to be set to FAST, which is the default for WebSphere MQ\non this platform.\nPage 139: the MQIBindType attribute of the Channels stanza is set by\ncrtmqm to FASTPATH. This should not be changed, except under the\ndirection of IBM Service.\nPage 140: the AdoptNewMCA=FASTPATH option is always required for\nthis platform in order for the adoption of MCAs to be effective. The\n\"Attention!\" box after the description of the FASTPATH option should\nbe ignored.\nPage 140: add the following description of the ClientIdle attribute:\nClientIdle=seconds\n\nClientIdle specifies the number of seconds of inactivity to permit\nbetween client application MQI calls before WebSphere MQ terminates\nthe client connection. The default is to not terminate client\nconnections however long they remain inactive. When a client connection\nis terminated because of idle activity, the client application receives\na connection broken result (2009) on its next MQI call.\n\nChapter 11 - Working with the WebSphere MQ Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) support\n\nA documentation supplement has been written to replace the sections on\nPage 170 (Preparing the queue manager's SSL files) to Page 176 (Building\nand verifying the sample configuration) because of changes to the files\nthat WebSphere MQ uses to hold certificates. The documentation supplement\nis called SSLupdate.pdf, and can be found in the opt\/mqm\/READMES\/en_US\ndirectory of an installation.\n\nChapter 12 - Transactional Support\n\nPage 185: The descriptions of the TMF attribute RMOPENPERCPU in the\n\nResource manager configuration section is modified as follows:\nRMOPENPERCPU\n\nEach WebSphere MQ thread or process that handles transactions has\nan open of a Volatile Resource Manager in the CPU it runs in. In\naddition, each application thread or process using the MQI also has\nan open. The minimum requirement for this configuration parameter\n\nis therefore the sum of:\n+ all Queue Server processes in that CPU\n+ all LQMA and MCA threads running in that CPU\n+ all MQI application threads running in that CPU\n+ 10 (to account for miscellaneous queue manager processes that\ncould be running in that CPU)\nYou should calculate the peak values of these numbers across all CPUs\nand add a safety margin to arrive at the correct value for your system.\nThe HP default value of 128 for this parameter is often suitable for\nsmall configurations, but unsuitable for medium or large ones.\n\n\nPage 186: add the following paragraph to the Troubleshooting section\nfor Configuring TMF:\nIf the RMOPENPERCPU value is not configured to allow sufficient opens\nof resource managers in a CPU, WebSphere MQ connections will fail with\nan unexpected return code, and FDCs will be generated reporting an\nerror with the TMF_VOL_RM_OPEN_. The workaround is to distribute\napplications and queue manager processes in the CPU that exceeds\nthe limit to other CPUs. The correct remedy is to schedule an outage\nand modify the TMF configuration.\n\nPage 186: add the following paragraph to the Troubleshooting section\nfor configuring TMF:\nIf TMF is stopped, or new transactions are disabled, and WMQ requires\nan internal \"unit of work\" (TMF transaction) to perform an update to\na protected resource requested by an MQI call, that call will fail\nand the reason code returned will be MQRC_UOW_NOT_AVAILABLE (2255).\n\nNote that in some cases, updates to protected resources may be\nrequired by MQI operations do not directly perform messaging\noperations - for example, MQOPEN of a model queue that creates a\npermanent dynamic queue. If MQI calls return MQRC_UOW_NOT_AVAILABLE,\ncheck the status of the TMF subsystem to determine the likely cause.\n\nChapter 14 - Process Management\n\nPage 197: the MQSC command to reload the process management rules is\nREFRESH QMGR TYPE(NSPROC) and not RESET QMGR TYPE(NSPROC)\n\nPage 200 and 204: the default value for the maximum number of unthreaded\nagents is now 200. The default value for the maximum number of threaded\nagents is now 20. the default value for the maximum use count for\nthreaded agents is now 100.\n\nPage 203: add a new paragraph titled \"Pathway\":\nPathway\nThis stanza contains 3 attributes:-\n- ProcessName\n- DynamicProcessName\n- Hometerm\nProcessName is the name of the Queue Managers pathmon process.\nIf the -np option was specified at queue Manager creation, \nthe value of ProcessName will be set to the value of that option \nwhen the qmproc.ini file is created\nIf DynamicProcessName is set to Yes, the system will generate a name\nfor the pathmon process at the time the Queue Manager starts.\nIf the value is set to no, the value of the ProcessName attribute\nwill determine the pathmon process name for the queue manager \nHometerm specifies the value of the hometerm attribute for the Queue \nManager pathmon process \nIf the -nh opton was specified at queue manager creation, the \nvalue of Hometerm will be set to the value of that option, \notherwise the default of $ZHOME will be used.\n\nPage 204: the \"valid attribute values\" for the attribute \"ExecutableName\"\nshould be stated as \"File name part only of the program to run for the\nLQMA or MCA process\".\n\nPages 203 - 205, Table 20: Process Management: Keyword definition Summary\nThere are a number of errors in the Process Management Keyword\ndefinition table:\n\n1.

Please use care when using altmqfls to set the queue options\n\n(--qsoptions parameter) and refer to the reference section for the\ncontrol commands for a complete description of using this option.\nPage 217: the bullet point that describes the configuration of AutoSYNC\nfilesets is incorrect when it states that NO ALLSYMLINKS should be\nspecified. Replace sub-bullet item number 2 with the following text:\n2. The entire queue manager OSS directory structure\nvar_installation_path\/var\/mqm\/qmgrs\/qmname.\n\nYou must specify the absolute path name of the queue manager's\ndirectory. Specify the ALLSYMLINKS option for this fileset to\nensure that AutoSYNC correctly synchronizes the symbolic link\n(G directory) in the queue manager's directory to the NonStop OS queue\nmanager's subvolume on the backup system.\n\nChapter 16 - Troubleshooting\n\nPage 230: after the section \"Is your application or system running\nslowly?\", insert the following new section:\nAre your applications or WebSphere MQ processes unable to connect?\n\nIf connection failures are occurring:\n\nis the User ID under which the application runs authorized to\nuse this queue manager?\nare SAFEGUARD permissions preventing read access to the WebSphere\nMQ installation files by the User ID running the application?\nare the environment variables established for the application\nprocess, so that the correct installation of WebSphere MQ is being\nused?\nif necessary, has the application been relinked or rebound with\nany static MQI libraries that it uses?\nis a resource problem preventing the queue manager from allowing\nthe connection? Review the troubleshooting section under TMF\nConfiguration on Page 185 and 186 for information about the\nRMOPENSPERCPU TMF attribute.\n\nChapter 18 - The control commands\n\nPage 93: The example of the --resetmeasure option is missing a mandatory\nparameter having the value \"YES\" or \"NO\". The paragraph on page 93 describing\nthe --resetmeasure option should be replaced with the following\n\n\"The queue server can maintain the Measure counter only if it is included \nin an active measurement. If it is not included in an active measurement, \nand messages are put in the queue and removed from the queue, the value \nof the counter will no longer represent the current depth of the queue. \nIf the counter is subsequently included in an active measurement, you can \ncause the queue server to reset the Measure counter to the current depth \nof the queue by using the --resetmeasure parameter on the altmqfls command, \nas follows: altmqfls --qmgr QMGR --type QLOCAL --resetmeasure TEST.QUEUE YES\"\n\nPage 244: The mandatory YES|NO parameter is missing from the syntax diagram\n\nPage 247: The mandatory YES|NO parameter is missing from the description\nof the option\n\nPage 243: the control commands for the Publish \/ Subscribe broker are\nnot referenced here. Refer to the WebSphere MQ V6.0 Publish\/Subscribe\nUser Guide and the documentation supplement for Publish\/Subscribe on\nHP NonStop Server - Pubsub.pdf.\nPage 255: if the OSS environment variable or Guardian PARAM MQPATHSEC\nis defined and set to one of the standard NonStop OS security attributes\n(A, N, C, G, O, or U) when crtmqm is run, the default PATHWAY SECURITY\nattribute value of \"G\" will be overridden by the value of the environment\nvariable \/ PARAM. This can be used to restrict access to the queue\nmanager's Pathway environment. The current Pathway attributes can be\ndisplayed in PATHCOM using the INFO PATHWAY command.\nPage 255: the -nu parameter for setting the default CPUS attribute\nin Pathway serverclasses does not accept all the values that Pathway\nallows for this attribute. The only accepted values (and the result in\nPathway configuration) are of the form:\n-nu value Pathway CPUS attribute\n-------- ---------------------\n-nu a CPUS (a:0)\n-nu a:b CPUS (a:b)\n\nMore complex Pathway serverclass CPUS attributes settings must be\nconfigured after the queue manager has been created, using the HP\nPATHCOM utility.\n\nChapter 23 - API exits\n\nPages 373-375: please review the updates to this section in the\ndocumentation supplement for API exits for HP NonStop Server called\nExits.pdf. This supplement has been extensively revised for V5.3.1.1\nto clarify the requirements and process for creating and integrating\nexits with WebSphere MQ.\n\nAppendix B - Directory structure\n\nPages 430 and 431: there is a new G symbolic link to the Guardian\nsubvolume containing the product executables in\n...\/var\/mqm\/qmgrs\/@SYSTEM\nPage 431: the content of the ssl directory is revised with V5.3.1.1\nas follows:\nThis directory contains up to four files used by the SSL support:\n\nThe queue manager certificate and private key store (cert.pem)\nThe trusted certificates store (trust.pem)\nThe pass phrase stash file for the queue managers certificate\nand private key store (Stash.sth)\nThe certificate revocation list file (optional - crl.pem)\n\nAppendix F - Environment variables\n\nPage 446: there are several environment variables that are used by the\nGuardian sample build scripts to locate the header files and the\nlibraries. Suitable settings for these are established in the\nWMQCSTM file (in the Guardian samples subvolume). The environment\nvariables, and their meanings, are:\nMQNSKOPTPATH^INC^G include file\/header subvolume\nMQNSKOPTPATH^BIN^G binaries subvolume\nMQNSKOPTPATH^LIB^G binaries subvolume\nMQNSKOPTPATH^SAMP^G samples subvolume\n\nIn addition, an HP environment variable is also required (and set in\nWMQCSTM) that locates the OSS DLLs for dynamic loading from Guardian.\nThe environment variable is ^RLD^FIRST^LIB^PATH.\n\nPage 468: add after the \"Queue Server Tuning parameters\" section\n\nQueue Manager Server tuning parameters\n\nMQQMSHKEEP If this ENV is set for the MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass, its value\nspecifies a numeric value in seconds to override the default housekeeping\ninterval of the queue manager server. The default interval is 60 seconds.\nThe housekeeping interval controls how frequently the queue manager\nserver generates expiration reports. The permitted range of values is 1-300.\nValues outside this range will be ignored and the default value will be used.\n\nMQQMSMAXMSGSEXPIRE If this ENV is set for the MQS-QMGRSVR00 serverclass,\nits value specifies a numeric value to override the default maximum number\nof expiration report messages that are generated during housekeeping\noperations by a queue manager server. The default maximum number of expiration\nmessages generated is 100. The permitted range of values is 1-99999. Values\noutside this range will be ignored and the default value will be used.\n\n\nAppendix H - Building and running applications\n\nBuilding C++ applications,\n\nTable 47 - there is no multi-threaded library support in\nGuardian so there should not be an entry for a\nmulti-threaded guardian library\n\nTable 48 - the name of this table should be \"Native non-PIC\"\n\nReferences to G\/lib symbolic links have changed with WMQ 5.3.1 to lib\/G\n\nNote that the MQNSKVARPATH and MQNSKOPTPATH environment variables must\nbe established in the environment, before an application starts up.\nThey cannot be programmatically set once a program is running by using\nputenv().\n\nPage 461: Building COBOL applications\n\nAdd the following text:\n\n\"In both the OSS and Guardian environment, the CONSULT compiler\ndirective referencing the MQMCB import library must now be used along\nwith correct linker options. Refer to the BCOBSAMP TACL script described\nin Appendix I for more information.\"\n\nAppendix I - WebSphere MQ for NonStop Server Sample Programs\n\nPages 465-466: The section \"TACL Macro file for building C Sample Programs\"\nis replaced by the following:\n\nBCSAMP - Build a C-Language Sample.\n\nThis TACL script will compile and link a C-language sample into an\nexecutable program. The script expects that the WMQ environment has\nbeen established using WMQCSTM.\n\nBCSAMP usage:\n\nBCSAMP <type> <source>\n\n<type> The type of executable program that should be built.\n\nValid values are:\n\npic A native PIC program\ntns A non-native TNS program\n\n<source> The filename of the source module to be compiled and linked\n\nThe <source> filename should end with a 'C'. The final program name is\nthe same as the source filename with the trailing 'C' removed.\n\nPage 467: The section \"TACL Macro files for building COBOL Sample\nPrograms\" is replaced by the following:\n\nBCOBSAMP - Build a COBOL Sample.\n\nThis TACL script will compile and link a COBOL sample into an executable\nprogram. The script expects that the WMQ environment has been established\nusing WMQCSTM.\n\nBCOBSAMP usage:\n\nBCOBSAMP <type> <source>\n\n<type> The type of executable program that should be built.\n\nValid values are:\n\npic A native PIC program\ntns A non-native TNS program\n\n<source> The filename of the source module to be compiled and linked\n\nThe <source> filename should end with an 'L'. The final program name is\nthe same as the <source> filename with the trailing 'L' removed.\n\nPage 469: The section \"TACL Macro files for building TAL sample programs\"\nis replaced by the following:\n\nBTALSAMP - Build a TAL Sample.\n\nThis TACL script will compile and link a TAL sample into an executable\nprogram. The script expects that the WMQ environment has been established\n\nusing WMQCSTM.\n\nBTALSAMP usage:\n\nBTALSAMP <source>\n\n<source> The filename of the source module to be compiled and linked\n\nThe final program name is the same as the <source> filename with the\ntrailing character removed.\n\nAppendix J - User exits\n\nrefer to the documentation supplement Exits.pdf for updated information\nabout configuring and building user exits. This supplement has been\nextensively revised for V5.3.1.1 to clarify the requirements and process\nfor creating and integrating exits with WebSphere MQ.\nThe description of compile options for PIC unthreaded, threaded and\nGuardian dlls in this document is incorrect. The option specified as\n\"-export all\" should be \"-export_all\".\n\nAppendix K - Setting up communications\n\nPage 482: The TCP\/IP keep alive function\n\nBy default, the TCP\/IP keep alive function is not enabled. To enable\nthis feature, set the KeepAlive=Yes attribute in the TCP Stanza in the\nqm.ini file for the queue manager.\nIf this attribute it set to \"yes\" the TCP\/IP subsystem checks periodically\nwhether the remote end of a TCP\/IP connection is still available. If it is\nnot available, the channel using the connection ends.\nIf TCP stanza KeepAlive attribute is not present or is set to \"No\", the\nTCP\/IP subsystem will not check for disconnection of the remote end.\n\nChapter 9 \"Configuring WebSphere MQ\" page 140 describes the TCP stanza\nattributes.\n\nAPAR IC58859: wmqtrig script\nThe wmqtrig script processing the -c option, for triggering a TACL macro\/script\nfile, will not normally propagate the TMC data to the macro\/script file.\nSome applications may need the TMC for processing. A switch used in conjunction\nwith the -c option, -5.1, has been added which will pass the TMC data to a TACL\nmacro\/script file with the wmqtrig script. Define the APPLICID attribute with\nthe -5.1 switch, for example:\nAPPLICID(\/wmq\/opt\/mqm\/bin\/wmqtrig -5.1 -c \\$data06.test.trigmac)\n\nSSLupdate.pdf page 7\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe SSLupdate.pdf document was first released with Fixpack 5.3.1.1\n\nThe SSL test scripts expect that a default TCP\/IP process ($ZTC0) is\nconfigured on the system to be used during the test. The configuration\nwill need modification if a non-default TCP\/IP process does not exist\non the system or another TCP\/IP process is used to communicate with the\npartner system. The ALICE.sh and\/or BOB.sh scripts that setup of the\nlistener (runmqlsr) will need modification to add the -g option to use a\nnon-default TCP\/IP process.\n\nCONTACTING IBM SOFTWARE SUPPORT\n===============================\n\nIBM Software Support provides assistance with product defects.

    "reference_doc": "IBM Purging the connection pool of a WebSphere Application Server data source using the data source MBean - United States\n\nwas app server TECHNOTE (TROUBLESHOOTING)\n\nPROBLEM(ABSTRACT)\n During the testing or troubleshooting of an enterprise application, it may become necessary to purge the connection pool of a WebSphere Application Server data source of existing connections. \n\nSYMPTOM\nChanges to the application or environment may invalidate cached connections in the Connection Manager pool. Although these connections will eventually be discarded through the normal processing of the connection requests, it may be desirable to purge them all at once and allow the pool to refill with new, valid connections.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nWebSphere Application Server has an operation on the data source MBean that can be used to purge the connection pool. WebSphere Application Server MBean may be called via the wsadmin console, see the IBM Information Center topic \"Scripting the application serving environment (wsadmin)\" for more details. The operation name is: purgePoolContents. \n\nThe purgePoolContents operation has two options: \n\n 1. Normal:  * This is the default option. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. \n     * Shared connection requests will be honored. \n     * Free connections are cleaned up and destroyed. \n     * In use connections (for example: connections in transactions) are cleaned up and destroyed when returned to the connection pool. \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents will be done synchronously (for example: wait for the jdbc driver to return before proceeding). \n     * Requests for new connections (not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n       \n       \n    \n    \n 2. Immediate:  * No new transactions will be allowed to start on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * No new handles will be handed out on any connections obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call. Instead, a StaleConnectionException is thrown. \n     * Existing in-flight transactions will be allowed to continue work. Any new activities on a purged Connection will cause a StaleConnectionException or an XAER_FAIL exception (in the case of XA) \n     * A close() call issued on any connection obtained prior to the purgePoolContents call will be done asynchronously (for example: no waiting for the jdbc driver to return) This is useful if the driver returns. \n     * Due to the fact that close() does not wait, the number of connections will be decremented immediately in WebSphere Application Server. This might cause the total number of connections in WebSphere Application Server to be temporarily out of sync with the database total number of connections. \n     * Requests for new connections (for example: not handles to existing old connections) will be honored.\n    \n    \n\n\nExamples of operations that can be executed on the data source MBean using the wasdmin console:  1. List all data sources:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,*\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,*\")\n    \n    \n 2. Initialize a variable to specify a data source (this example uses Default Datasource, but any data source name listed in the output of above command can be used):\n    Using Jacl:\n    set name \"Default Datasource\"\n    set ds [$AdminControl queryNames *:type=DataSource,name=$name,*] \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    name = \"Default Datasource\"\n    ds = AdminControl.queryNames(\"*:type=DataSource,name=\"+name+\",*\") \n    \n    \n 3. View the pool contents by invoking the showPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showPoolContents\n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 4. View contents of all pools by invoking the showAllPoolContents operation of the data source MBean:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds showAllPoolContents\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    print AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"showAllPoolContents\")\n    \n    \n 5. Immediately purge the pool by invoking the purgePoolContents operation of the data source MBean with the immediate option:\n    Using Jacl:\n    $AdminControl invoke $ds purgePoolContents immediate\n    \n    \n    Using Jython:\n    AdminControl.invoke(ds, \"purgePoolContents\", \"immediate\")\n    \n    \n\nIf the purge operation is successful, no response will be observed. If the purge operation is not successful, the response will indicate a possible reason for failure. One common reason for failure is attempting to purge the contents of a connection pool which is not yet available (the connection pool is not created until a naming look-up of the associated datasource or connection factory occurs), resulting in an illegal state exception.  \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK Application Servers WebSphere Application Server for z\/OS Java SDK z\/OS 8.0, 7.0, 6.1",

The performance of the application under this load is considered good (you will see \"Good\"\" in the Application Health views) and deviation from this performance indicates degrading health (\"Bad\" or \"Fair\" in the Application Health views) of the monitored application. \n\nTo start baselining for your application server, please follow these steps: \n\n(Note 1: in this example, I've used a WebSphere-based application but you can also do the same for any application on your J2EE agent also.) \n\n(Note 2: Before beginning baselining, make sure you have typical or normal load on the server to set the baselining threshold values.) \n\n1. Login to your TEPS, select Application Health, right-click on it, go to Workspace and select Application Registry. Look at the panels on the right and observe the baselining columns. If they're blank, your baselining has not been started. \n\n2. Next select Application Health, right-click on it, go to Workspace and select Application Health status. If you see Unknown, then you know the baselining has not started or not been calculated. \n\n3. High-lite your application, select the small yellow chain link in the first unnamed column and select Application Configuration Details. See screenshot here: \n\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=1] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=1] \n\n4. In the bottom panel on the right select the line that says All and high-lite it. Then right-click it, select Take Action and Select. In the pull-down, select Start_Baselining and enter the Period (2 days), Update_Interval (every 2 hours), and Run_Clean set to 1 (clean start.) If you wish, you can change these values to whatever you want. \n\nSee screenshots here:\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=2] [\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&aid=2]\n[\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21653905&amp;aid=3]\nHit OK twice and you should get a Command completed successfully message. (Note: If you get a Baselining_Already_Active message in the pop-up window, then you should do another Take Action and Stop_Baselining first if you want to do the baselining again.)\n\nOnce you have the baselining active, let it run for the period of time with typical load on the server. After the baselining is complete, the Unknown values in the Application Health should now change to Good or Fair or Bad depending on threshold values.\n\n \n\n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Systems and Asset Management Tivoli Composite Application Manager for Web Resources ITCAM for Web Resources (J2EE TEMA) AIX, HP-UX, Linux, Solaris, Windows, Solaris Opteron 6.1, 6.2 Advanced \nPRODUCT ALIAS\/SYNONYM\n ITCAM ITCAM4AD ITCAMfAD TEMA ITCAM for Web Resources",

The NormalizeCCO goes through the CCO file, and cleans up all the entries so they appear in regular lines. For most images this improves ultimate recognition results, but for some complex images, NormalizeCCO cannot determine where to separate the lines and merges all words into a single line.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nAdd the following action prior to NormalizeCCO. \n\n * \n * \n\nThe first parameter is the percentage of a line that two words must be offset to be considered as separate lines. If the value is not set, the default is 50. In the example, if two words are vertically offset by more than 35% of the height of the words, then they are considered to be on separate lines. Lower values are more likely to split words into separate lines.

    "reference_doc": "IBM Information Server QualityStage Match Designer Database creation - United States\n\nMD Match Designer Matching Match InformationServer QualityStage TECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do I configure the Match Designer Database in Information Server? \n\nANSWER\nThis Technote outlines the following procedures. \n\n 1. Prerequisites \n 2. What is the Match Database’s purpose? \n 3. Setting the database up. \n 4. Configuring the Match Designer for use with the Database. \n 5. On going maintenance \n\n\nPrerequisites \nThe following must exist before using the Match Designer functionality.  1. Match Specification built for use in match designer. \n 2. Create a data set that contains the data you will run the match analysis on. \n 3. Create a corresponding frequency data set to be used in the match analysis. \n 4. DSN for local PC \n 5. Create Database in which to perform the Match analysis processing. \n    a) Sizing of Database \n    b) Character sets required \n    c) Permission's for users \n\n\nAdditional information is also available with in the WebSphere QualityStage User Guide. \n\nWhat it’s the Match Database’s purpose?  1. The results Database is used to test the match specifications (logic) designed for use in match jobs. \n 2. This functionality enables the user to get a baseline of how good the match criteria are, based on the match logic developed for use in the application. \n 3. The results Database stores statistics and match results based on your data. For Example: How many matches, duplicates, and unmatched records. \n 4. This functionality allows developers to change matching logic on the fly and retest within minutes. \n\n * There is nothing from this Database that is used in production runs so it should never be created on or moved to a production box. \n * The Match Designer is to be used for development purposes only with a \"subset\" of the full volume data. If additional match modifications are required continue to use a subset of data not conduct testing with full volume data. \n * Determining the subset size of data to use in the Match Designer will vary depending on the clients environment and resources. Each client should run several iterations to determine the optimal subset to utilize in the Match Designer step. \n * To obtain the most accurate matching thresholds a full volume run should be performed in the DataStage Designer.\n\n\nCreating the Database  1. You should start from an empty Database; using the default XMETA Database is not recommended because it can become corrupt. \n 2. There are certain requirements on how the Database is to be created. \n    a) If Oracle: CHARACTERSET should be set to AL32UTF \n    b) If SQL: default is fine. \n    c) If DB2: create as codepage UTF-8 and page size 32K \n    d) Permission’s - Each user has to have the ability to create tables, write and read rights in the DB. \n    e) The minimum DB space required will be calculated as follows = Number of Passes in match specification (X) Number of Input Records (X) Input Record Length (+) 100 filler.\n    f) If this is a distributed installation, you need to have ODBC defined in your client and on the server. They must have the same name. \n\n\nConfiguring the Match Designer for use with the Database  1.  Via the DataStage Designer navigate to the your match specification to work with \n 2.  Double click and a window will appear indicating: \n     “The ODBC Data Source Name (xxxxxxx) currently specified for this Match could not be found. Please create a DSN by this name or run a Test Environment Update to configure a different DSN for this Specification.” \n 3.  Select the “OK” button \n 4.  Select option “Configure Specification” \n 5.  From drop down select “Test Environment” \n 6.  For “Sample Information” navigate to the location of your data set(s) created for analysis. \n 7.  Under “Frequency Information” navigate to the location of your frequency data set(s) created for use. \n 8.  Section “Test Results Database” fill the following information in. \n     a. Select the DSN created for the will allow the connection to the Database. \n     b. Enter user name required \n     c. Password required \n     d. Test Connection \n     e. Configuration File Location; these are the nodes located in your environment for use. Please make sure this matches the location of where the data sets reside on the server. \n 9.  Once connection is established hit the “Update” button. This will populate the Database with the required fields (not data) to populate when you perform the test specification. \n 10. The final step is to perform the Test All Passes. Please note this make take a few moments depending on the size of the files used. \n\n\nOngoing Maintenance  1. For each new run, results are cleared and rewritten to the DB. \n 2. Each user should have their own respective Databases to avoid rewriting over previous results. \n 3. There are separate tables holding results for each design. And from one user it is no problem to use a single Database and multiple designs. \n 4. Per the recommendation above in \"Creating the Database\" this database should not be your XMETA database. If you used the XMETA DO NOT RUN THIS STEP. When you are done testing you can drop the DB altogether.",

It is also possible to set HTTP Session time-out for the application packaging process. \n\nSince Session time-out can be set in multiple places, it is necessary to understand how the ultimate Session time-out for an application is determined. \n\nCAUSE\nApplication needs HTTP session time-out set.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nThe HTTP Session time-out can be set in the following places: \n\n * From the Administrative Console at the server, Enterprise application, and Web application levels \n * At the time when the application is packaged \n * In the application code\n\n\nSetting the HTTP Session time-out from the Administrative Console \n1. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the server level, navigate to Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management. \n\nIn the Session time-out section of this window, you can select No time-out or Set time-out by clicking the appropriate radio button. If you choose to set the time-out, type the desired value in minutes in the box. \n\n\n2. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Enterprise Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level. \n\n\n3. To set the HTTP Session time-out at the Web Application level, navigate to Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management. \n\nCheck Override in the Override Session Management section, then select to set the time-out and the time-out value. This sets the Application Session to overwrite those values set at the parent levels, which in this case is the Server or Enterprise Application level. \n\nAfter modifying these settings, save the master configuration. \n\nSetting HTTP Session time-out when application is packaged \n\nThe application developer can also select to set the HTTP Session time-out parameter when the application is packaged. This value is stored in the web.xml file for the Web application. \n\nThis setting overrides any session time-outs defined from the Administrative Console. Alter this setting by repackaging the application with a new value, or by modifying the web.xml file. The entry in the web.xml will be as follows: \n          <session-config> \n      *          <session-timeout>60<\/session-timeout>\n * \n *       <\/session-config>\n\n \n\nWhere the \"session-timeout\" is an integer value for the desired session time-out in minutes. \nSetting HTTP Session time-out from the application code \n\nFinally, the HTTP Session time-out can be set in the application code. The programmer can invoke the setMaxInactiveInterval() method on HttpSession object to set the time-out value as desired. This setting overrides any time-out defined in the application package or made from the Administrative Console. \n\nHTTP Session time-out Override Precedence Summary \n\nThe list below shows the precedence from which the final HTTP Session time-out is derived. \n\n1.

The EventReader captures the event and then uses the highest captured StateChange value in its outgoing SQL to capture pertinent events.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nPertinent events are not being processed. Looking in the EventReader log file the number of events being captured in each Read is 0. Testing the SQL being used in an nco_sql session produces a 0 result too. Testing the SQL again in an nco_sql session without the \"and StateChange >= 1234567890\" clause returns all the unprocessed rows.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nSomething has \"future dated\" the StateChange value of an event in the ObjectServer, the EventReader captured the event and, since the EventReader will use the highest StateChange value captured in the previous poll in the SQL of its next poll, this then future dated the value used in the EventReader. The EventReader will persist with this value (and will increment it by 1 every other poll) until such a time as it captures an event with a higher StateChange value.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe simplest solution is to manually reset the EventReader StateChange value via the GUI. Stop the EventReader, open it for edit, click the \"Clear State\" button, exit the editor and restart the EventReader.\n\nAn alternate solution is to perform this operation via the Command Line Interface:\n\n\n\n * telnet [Hostname] [Port]\n\n\nwhere [Hostname] is the resolvable hostname of the ImpactServer host and [Port] is the CLI port number (2000, by default). You will need to supply a suitable username (admin, for example) and password. Then at the READY prompt enter the series of commands: \n\n * Update Service set Running=false where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n * \n * Update Service set ClearState=true where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n * \n * Update Service set Running=true where Name='[EventReaderName]';\n\n\nwhere [EventReaderName] is the name of the EventReader that requires this restart process. \n\nIn cases where the likelihood of StateChange being inappropriately incremented in this fashion is quite high, one might wish to automate this process and have a Policy hunt for such occurrences. Please find following an example of a \"hunter\" Policy to capture any reoccurrence of this issue: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * ANN=\"AcquireStateChange\"; \n   Log(2,ID+ANN); \n   Script=\"\/opt\/IBM\/netcool\/impact\/bin\/CheckState.sh\"; \n   Parameter=\"password\"; \n   JRExecAction(Script, Parameter, false, 30); \n   NumExecOutput=Length(ExecOutput); \n   Log(3,ID+ANN+\": NumExecOutput: \"+NumExecOutput); \n   \n   If(NumExecOutput >= 1) \n   {  * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * Log(ID+ANN+\": CurrentStateChange: \"+HumanStateChange+\" is greater than CurrentTime: \"+HumanCurrentTime); \n      Log(ID+ANN+\": !!! Clearing EventReader State !!!\"); \n      Script=\"\/opt\/IBM\/netcool\/impact\/bin\/ClearState.sh\"; \n      Parameter=\"password\"; \n      JRExecAction(Script, Parameter, false, 30); \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * Log(1,ID+ANN+\": CurrentStateChange: \"+HumanStateChange+\" is less than CurrentTime: \"+HumanCurrentTime); \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * \n    * Log(ID+ANN+\": !!!

If it finds any it then acquires the StateChange value from the .state file via JRExecServer using the example script referred to in the above example Policy as CheckState.sh: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nIf the Policy finds the string it extracts the StateChange value and compares it against the current time and, if StateChange exceeds the current time, it undertakes the stop, clear and restart of the EventReader to bring StateChange back into line. \n\nThis examples a simple script to use the Command Line Interface to stop the EventReader, clear the StateChange value and restart the EventReader and is referred to in the above exampled Policy as ClearState.sh: \n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\n\nPlease note that the ClearState.sh script should not contain any spaces or special characters otherwise calling EOF will throw errors. Also, in latter versions of Impact, the username and password should be those of the tipadmin. Additionally, rather than have the password sitting clear case in a script one can pass it as a JRExecAction Parameter from the Policy - still clear case but the relevance of the variable can be made less obvious. \n\nBoth of these scripts are called by the JRExecAction() function in the example Policy and this in turn requires the JRExecServer to be running on the ImpactServer host(s *). \n\n* - The JRExecServer will be used by the current Primary ImpactServer only, as all EventReaders and PolicyActivators are run on the current Primary only but, if and when failover occurs and the Secondary ImpactServer becomes Primary, this new Primary will require access to a running, local JRExecServer. So, JRExecServer has to be running on both Primary and Secondary ImpactServer hosts to ensure availability in case of failover. Some additional information about the JRExecAction() function is available from the TechNote \"JRExecAction() function usage\" [Link Below] \nRELATED INFORMATION\n JRExecAction() function usage [http:\/\/www-01.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21515756]",

For example, after importing data from a production database to a test database, the Oracle Text indexes will not be transferred. This will require you to recreate them in order for certain functions in Atlas to work properly. \n\nIf you have access to the Atlas release files from the version you are currently using you can follow these instructions. You will need the ability to access the Atlas database using the Oracle SQL Plus tool. \n\n \n\n 1. Shutdown the application server running the Atlas applications. \n 2.

One option is for file uploads and other option is for file downloads. \n * A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional white-list of MIME types. MIME types that are included in the list are allowed for uploads, but all other MIME types are blocked from uploads. \n * A server-side configuration option is introduced, which allows you to specify an optional black-list of MIME type mappings. Each MIME type mapping allows for a conversion to be made from a specific MIME type to a specific MIME type upon download.\n\n\nThe following example is a sample configuration of new options, which you can configure in the 100Custom.xml file: \n\n<server> \n<!-- mime type white list which specifies mime types accepted for --> \n<!-- upload to document list or document attachment --> \n<document-attachment-accepted-mime-types> \n<!-- specifies whether to allow a null mime type for upload --> \n<allow-null-mime-type>false<\/allow-null-mime-type> \n<!-- lists the mime types allowed for upload --> \n<mime-type>text\/plain<\/mime-type> \n<mime-type>img\/png<\/mime-type> \n<\/document-attachment-accepted-mime-types> \n\n<!-- mime type black list which specifies mappings from unacceptable --> \n<!-- mime types to acceptable mime types for download from --> \n<!-- document list or document attachment --> \n<document-attachment-download-mime-types> \n<!-- will map text\/html mime type to text\/plain mime type --> \n<mime-type-map> \n<from>text\/html<\/from> \n<to>text\/plain<\/to> \n<\/mime-type-map> \n<!-- missing <to> element implies mapping to content\/octet-stream --> \n<mime-type-map> \n<from>application\/pdf<\/from> \n<\/mime-type-map> \n<\/document-attachment-download-mime-types> \n<\/server> \n\nNote: The default configuration, which does not include the configuration information that is provided in the 100Custom.xml file, acts as a blacklist for the text\/html MIME type and maps it to the text\/plain MIME type. Providing a configuration in the 100Custom.xml file overrides the default configuration. As a result, for text\/html to remain on the blacklist, it should be explicitly added to the 100Custom.xml file.

Eclipse changed the window system requirement from motif to gtk on UNIX operating systems. For AIX, this Eclipse window system change requires the gtk libraries to be installed to support the GUI. For Installation Manager, the GUI is the wizard mode of operation. \n\nYou can use Installation Manager without the gtk libraries. For information on console mode, command-line mode, or silent mode; see the Installation Manager Information Center [http:\/\/pic.dhe.ibm.com\/infocenter\/install\/v1r6\/topic\/com.ibm.cic.agent.ui.doc\/topics\/c_modes.html]. Silent mode uses a response file and command-line mode is supported by all packages. For console mode, check your product documentation to verify that the product supports console mode.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nTo use the GUI, the gtk+ RPM and dependencies must be available on AIX. \n\n\nInstall this set of RPMs on AIX:\n\n\natk-1.12.3-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ncairo-1.8.8-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nexpat-2.0.1-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfontconfig-2.4.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nfreetype2-2.3.9-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngettext-0.10.40-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nglib2-2.12.4-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\ngtk2-2.10.6-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibjpeg-6b-6.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nlibpng-1.2.32-2.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nlibtiff-3.8.2-1.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npango-1.14.5-4.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\npixman-0.12.0-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxcursor-1.1.7-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nxft-2.1.6-5.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\nxrender-0.9.1-3.aix5.2.ppc.rpm\nzlib-1.2.3-3.aix5.1.ppc.rpm\n\nThe installed RPMs must be of the minimum versions listed above.\n\nTo install the RPM versions specified above take the following steps: \n\n\n 1. Download the gtk2_bundle_v2.tar package [ftp:\/\/ftp.software.ibm.com\/aix\/freeSoftware\/aixtoolbox\/ezinstall\/ppc\/] (version 'v2') containing all the RPMs and the install script to a new directory. \n    \n    \n 2. Decompress the tar file. \n    You can use the command tar -xvf gtk2_bundle_<version>.tar to decompress the file.\n    \n    \n 3. Open the decompressed directory gtk2_bundle_<version> and run the install.sh script.\n    \n    The script will check if the required RPMs are installed at the compatible level. If they are not, the script will prompt to install the compatible versions.\n    \n    \n 4. Verify the environment variable LIBPATH contains a path to the installed libraries. \n    For example LIBPATH=\/opt\/freeware\/lib\/\n\n\nNote that if you download and install RPMs individually, we have found that the following libraries are incompatible:  * glib2-2.14.6-2 and gtk2-2.10.6-5 \n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n#Unreadable characters in the GUI when using X11 [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/docview.wss?uid=swg21661861]",

The installation appears to succeed, but IBM MQ 8.0.0.2 is installed and the subsequent fixpack update is not applied. This affects IBM MQ Pure Application System pattern-types 1.0.0.2 and earlier, leading to the following restrictions: \n\n * For IBM Pure Application System releases earlier than 2.1.2.0 and at version 2.1.2.1, you can install all versions of IBM MQ contained in the pattern-type. You can also apply maintenance to running pattern instances. \n * For IBM Pure Application System 2.1.2.0, 2.2.0.0 and later, you can install IBM MQ 8.0.0.2 only. You cannot install later versions e.g., 8.0.0.4. You cannot apply maintenance to running pattern instances.\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nA new maintenance.py lifecycle script is available to enable installation and migration of the latest maintenance level of IBM MQ contained in the pattern-type. \n\n\nThis update, and installation steps, can be obtained from IBM Fix Central:\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/fixcentral\/swg\/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EWebSphere&product=ibm\/WebSphere\/WebSphere+MQ&release=8.0&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=1.0.0.2-WS-MQ-Pure-LAIT15252&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc [http:\/\/www.ibm.com\/support\/fixcentral\/swg\/quickorder?parent=ibm%7EWebSphere&product=ibm\/WebSphere\/WebSphere+MQ&release=8.0&platform=All&function=fixId&fixids=1.0.0.2-WS-MQ-Pure-LAIT15252&includeSupersedes=0&source=fc]\n\n\nAPAR IT15252 has been raised for the IBM MQ development team to address this issue within future releases of the IBM MQ Pure Application System pattern-type.",

In most instances, this object is the attribute that was put into the session object; however, sometimes this object is referenced by an attribute of the session object. \n\n To determine which attribute of the session object references this non-serializable object, access the SessionInspectServlet.\n\n\nRESOLVING THE PROBLEM\nImplement the Java.io.Serializable or Java.io.Externalizable interface\n\nWith persistent sessions enabled, any object that is put into the HTTPSession must implement the serializable interface in order for session manager to store the session data outside of JVM.\n\nWhen PMI is enabled, there is a counter for session data size. In order to evaluate this counter, the session data must be serialized into a byte array stream. Any object that is put into the HTTPSession must implement the serializable interface in order for session manager to convert the session data objects into byte array stream.\n\nFor example:\n\npublic classMyObject implementsSerializable{\n}\/\/end of class MyObject\n\nCheck that all objects placed in the HTTPSession implement the java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interface.\n\n\n 1. Acess the SessionInspectServlet\n    \n    If the class name printed in the exception is not an object that is explicitly placed into the HTTPSession, use the SessionInspectServlet to determine the attribute in the HTTPSession that references a non-serializable object. \n\n\n\nSessionInspectServlet helps application writers to determine if application is written to support session persistence. SessionInspectServlet helps to: \n\n * Determine attributes present in the session\n   \n * Determine serializable and non-serializable attributes in the session\n   \n * Determine the size of each serializable attribute in session\n   \n * Determine if serializable attribute is implemented properly (if serializable attribute and all its internals are serializable)\n\n\nServlet serializes and deserializes attributes into memory to simulate session persistence; therefore, application writers need not turn on session persistence to run this servlet. However, you can run it with persistent sessions enabled. \n\nHow to Access the SessionInspectServlet: \n 1. com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet is shipped with WebSphere Application Server. It is already in the classpath and does not need to be added to the application. \n    \n    Define a servlet\/uri entry for class SessionInspectServlet. If ServeServletsByClassnameEnabled is set to true (check the ibm-web-ext.xmi file in the WEB-INF directory of your webModule) in your webModule, servlet\/uri definition is not needed. \n    \n 2. Restart your Web module.\n    \n 3. Open a browser and access your Web module from the browser, then navigate the application in the browser to populate the session.\n    \n 4. Press Crtl+N to open a new browser, then access the SessionInspectServlet in the new browser by calling the URI that you defined in step 2. If you are using ServeServletsbyClassname, the URI will be \"webapp_context_root\\servlet\\com.ibm.ws.webcontainer.httpsession.SessionInspectServlet\". This displays the session details at that moment. You can access the servlet as you navigate your application to determine the session contents as you go along. Note: The servlet does not support attributes in the session that are outside the WebSphere Application Server scope. That is, session contents need to be accessed by the server class loader scope.\n\n \n\nCross reference information Segment Product Component Platform Version Edition Application Servers Runtimes for Java Technology Java SDK",

The following Wiki page has been published on the topic:\nhttps:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/community\/wikis\/home?lang=en#!\/wiki\/Tivoli+Composite+Application+Manager\/page\/Pruning+SDMS+Relationship+Metrics+Tables [https:\/\/www.ibm.com\/developerworks\/community\/wikis\/home?lang=en#!\/wiki\/Tivoli+Composite+Application+Manager\/page\/Pruning+SDMS+Relationship+Metrics+Tables]\n\nTo keep only the latest 24 hours every day (regular pruning), you can schedule a daily job to run the kd4TrimDB2db utility provided above. \n\nAs for the newer ITCAM for SOA 7.2, there is a cleanup task that runs on the TEPS host where SDMS database is installed. It deletes REQMETRICS and RESPMETRICS table rows where SRTTIME (start of period) is more than 24 hours ago. So these two tables, which are responsible for most of KD4SDMS storage occupation, should not grow unbounded anymore.\n\nNOTE: ITCAM for SOA 7.1.1 is Out-Of-Support since 2015 April 30.",

This can result in transactions being rolled back, thereby resulting in the addon installation failing.\n\nDIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM\nExamine both the P8 error log and the DB2 diagnostic logs for each active member for lock timeout error messages similar to the following:\n\n\nDB2 (db2diag.log):\nFUNCTION: DB2 UDB, lock manager, sqlplWaitOnWP, probe:999 \n\n MESSAGE : ZRC=0x80100044=-2146435004=SQLP_LTIMEOUT\n\"LockTimeOut - tran rollback Reason code 68 \n\nP8 (p8_server_error.log): \ncom.filenet.api.exception.EngineRuntimeException: FNRCE0019E: E_DEADLOCK_ERROR: The operation could not be completed due to a deadlock error.

    "reference_doc": "IBM How to export and import keys from an HSM-enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance - United States\n\nTECHNOTE (FAQ)\n\nQUESTION\n How do I export and import private keys between the same or different Hardware Security Module (HSM) enabled IBM WebSphere DataPower SOA Appliance? \n\nANSWER\nHSM-enabled DataPower appliances support the export of private keys using the crypto-export command. For key export to work, various conditions must be met: \n\n * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines \n * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen's exportable option) \n * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.\n\n\nEach HSM has a special key inside of it, the key-wrapping key, that is used to encrypt exported private keys (and to decrypt imported private keys). If the goal is to restore exported keys to the same appliance, then you don't need to worry about hsm-clone-kwk, red keys, or the hsm-domain parameter. That is because the key-wrapping key at import time will already match the key-wrapping key at export time (since the HSM device is the same). If the goal is to move exported keys from one appliance to another one, then all of the steps in this section must be followed :- \n\nFirst, the two HSMs in question must be both be initialized and in the same key sharing domain. This means that they must both be initialized in the same mode (both in Security Level 2 or both in Security Level 3). In Security Level 2 mode, they must have used the same hsm-domain parameter during hsm-reinit (this parameter has a default value that is the same on all appliances). In Security Level 3 mode, they must have used the same red PED key during hsm-reinit (and the second initialization must not have overwritten the key value from the first initialization). \n\nSecond, the key to be exported must be exportable. The exportability of keys is immutable. It is determined at keygen time, and it is controlled by that command's exportable parameter. If a key was created outside of the appliance (not using keygen), then it is always considered exportable. \n\nFinally, before the crypto-export crypto-import sequence, the key-wrapping keys must be synchronized using the hsm-clone-kwk command. This command must be run four times: once on the source HSM appliance (with the key-wrapping key you are copying), once on the destination HSM appliance, once again on the source HSM appliance, and once again on the destination HSM appliance. Each time the command is run, it will need the output file from the previous step (as the input to the current step) which must be moved manually (usually with the copy command). \n\nOnce all of this has been done, then private keys may move from system to system with crypto-export and crypto-import. \n\nNote that the non-HSM appliance can export keys immediately at keygen time, but never at a later time. \n\nFor additional information refer to the online Info Center [http:\/\/publib.boulder.ibm.com\/infocenter\/wsdatap\/v3r8m2\/index.jsp?topic=%2Fxi50%2Fwelcome.htm] and search for \"PIN entry device\".\n\nNote: You will need to sign into the documentation portal with your IBM Registration ID and password.",
    "original_ground_truth": "HSM-enabled DataPower appliances support the export of private keys using the crypto-export command. For key export to work, various conditions must be met: \n\n * HSMs must be initialized and in the same key sharing domain on exporting and importing machines \n * The private key in question must be marked exportable at keygen time (see keygen's exportable option) \n * HSMs on exporting and importing machines must share internal key-wrapping keys (see hsm-clone-kwk command). A key-wrapping key is a key that encrypts another key.",
