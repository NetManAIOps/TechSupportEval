For IHS v7, the specific module and its location might differ from what's mentioned for v8.5 and v9.0, so refer to the documentation specific to your version.\n   - Create an SSL virtual host stanza in the httpd.conf file. This involves specifying the SSL protocol, certificates, and other SSL-related directives.\n4. **Specifically for mutual authentication**, you will need to configure the server to request a client certificate during the SSL handshake. This typically involves setting the `SSLVerifyClient` directive to `require` within the virtual host configuration.

Only use the steps listed in the given options.\n\nText:\nTo resolve the timeout issue when processing large orders with WebSphere Business Integration (WBI) Adapter for Siebel V2.6, you can modify the connection settings by creating a `siebel.properties` file. \n\nSpecifically, you can increase the `siebel.conmgr.txtimeout` value, which indicates the transaction timeout in milliseconds (default is 600000, or 10 minutes), and/or adjust the `siebel.conmgr.sesstimeout` value, which indicates the session timeout in seconds (default is 2700, or 45 minutes).\n\nHere's an example of how you can update these values in the `siebel.properties` file:\n\n```\nsiebel.conmgr.txtimeout = 1200000  # Increase transaction timeout to 20 minutes\nsiebel.conmgr.sesstimeout = 5400  # Increase session timeout to 90 minutes\n```\n\nAfter updating the `siebel.properties` file, save it in the classpath of the adapter (e.g., `<adapter project>\\connectorModule`) and restart the adapter and broker to apply the changes.\n\nBy increasing these timeout values, you may be able to prevent the timeout error (SBL-JCA-317) and successfully process large orders. However, be cautious when adjusting these settings, as increasing timeouts can impact system performance. Monitor your system's behavior after making these changes to ensure they have the desired effect.\n\nSteps:\nA.

Add the property `impact.[EventReaderName].consolidatefilters=false` to the file. For example, if your EventReader name is omnibuseventreader, the property should be `impact.omnibuseventreader.consolidatefilters=false`.\n\n3. After adding the property, restart the ImpactServer to enable the change. If you are in a Clustered environment, first stop the Secondary ImpactServer(s), then stop and restart the Primary ImpactServer, and finally restart the Secondary ImpactServer(s) to ensure the property is distributed correctly and not overwritten.\n\nThis solution does not affect the EventReader's ability to parse the Filter but is specifically related to the use of the Filter Analyzer.

Use an action to identify the pages with status 20, e.g., `PageStatusIDByValue (20, HidePage)`.\n3. Create a rule with the action `DeleteChildType(HidePage)` and attach it at the batch level. This will remove all pages with page type \"HidePage\" (i.e., pages with status 20) from the batch view.\n\nBy doing this, when you navigate through pages in dotedit batch view, the panel for the page with status 20 should not load, and you should not be able to submit the batch if it's the only page left.\n\nNote that this approach effectively removes the page from the batch view, rather than just hiding it. If you want to simply hide the page without removing it, you may need to explore other customization options or consult the Datacap documentation for alternative solutions.",

This property increases the file size limit to handle large character lengths for the `USERPARAMETERS` parameter.\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Identify the required file size limit**: Determine the appropriate size limit (e.g., 8192, 16384, 32768, etc.) based on the length of your `USERPARAMETERS` property, including the property name and definition.\n\n2. **Add the property to the configuration files**: On each ImpactServer in the Cluster, open the `<SERVERNAME>_server.props` file located in `$NCHOME/impact/etc/` and add the following line, replacing `<size>` with your chosen size limit:\n   ```\n   nci.type.file.size.limit=<size>\n   ```\n   Ensure there are no trailing white-space characters, as they can invalidate properties in lower versions of Impact.\n\n3. **Restart the ImpactServers**: After adding the property to all servers, restart each ImpactServer to enable the new configuration. It's crucial that the ImpactServer started as Primary has the correct, uncorrupted `.type` file to be replicated across the Cluster.\n\n4. **Verify the resolution**: After restarting, check the `.type` file on the Secondary ImpactServer to ensure it is no longer truncated and that the DataType is correctly replicated.\n\nThis solution applies to all versions of Netcool/Impact, although the specific APAR (IZ81446) mentioned is not an issue in Impact 6 and 7. However, adding the property is still necessary to handle large character lengths for the `USERPARAMETERS` parameter in those versions.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Add the property to a file, the file is typically found at <BLANK 1>.\n   The property must be added to the specified server properties file where the size limit can be set to values such as 8192, 16384, 32768, etc.\n2.

Backup and edit the following files:\n   - `TWA_HOME/WAS/TWSProfile/config/cells/TWSNodeCell/security.xml`\n   - `TWA_HOME/WAS/TWSProfile/properties/ssl.client.props`\n   - `TWA_HOME/WAS/TWSProfile/temp/ssl.client.props`\n\n2. In `security.xml`, find `sslProtocol` and change `\"SSL_TLS\"` to `\"TLS\"`. Also, find `ssl.protocol` and change `value=\"SSL\"` to `value=\"TLS\"`.\n\n3. In `ssl.client.props` files, find `com.ibm.ssl.protocol=SSL` and change it to `com.ibm.ssl.protocol=TLS`.\n\n4. Stop and restart WAS.\n\nNote: After making these changes, your TWS engines will be using TLS. If you have any DWC 9.2 or 9.1 installations that need to connect to these engines, you will also need to reconfigure them to use TLS by making the same changes in their respective `security.xml` and `ssl.client.props` files.\n\nAdditionally, be aware that configuring TWS engines to use TLS may impact the Dynamic Agent, so it's recommended to review technote 1689332 for further information.\n\nSteps:\nA.

This can be done without restarting the database server.\n3. **Contact Rational Support** to repair the session index file. This requires all users to log out and the DOORS database server to be shut down until the repaired file is returned and inserted.\n\n**Important:** Any modifications to the files in your DOORS database should only be performed by Rational Support, as they could result in data corruption and jeopardize your DOORS database.\n\nBefore proceeding, ensure you have the necessary support and follow the recommended steps carefully to avoid any further issues.",

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Create a custom SSP resolver class**: Implement the `IlrSSPResolver` interface and override the `getSSPURL(String serverName, URL url)` method. This method should return the URL of the SSP server based on the server name.\n2. **Add the custom SSP resolver to the teamserver.war**: Package the custom SSP resolver class into the teamserver.war file.\n3. **Set the teamserver.defaultSSPResolver.class property**: Configure the `teamserver.defaultSSPResolver.class` property to point to your custom SSP resolver class.\n4. **Define multiple servers in RTS**: Define multiple servers in Rule Team Server (RTS) with different URLs, such as `testingServer1` and `testingServer2`.\n5. **Implement the getSSPURL method**: In the `getSSPURL` method, use the server name to return the specific SSP URL.

If the transactional operation takes longer than this timeout to complete, the transaction is rolled back and the operation is not completed, resulting in the user being kicked out.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try increasing the transaction timeout value in the `web.xml` file by changing the value of the `ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout` property. For example, you can increase the value to 1200 seconds (20 minutes) or more, depending on the complexity of the operations being performed.\n\nAdditionally, you should also check the application server-specific transaction timeout configurations, such as the \"Maximum transaction timeout\" in WebSphere Application Server, and increase it as needed.\n\nIt's worth noting that the session timeout, which is set to 30 minutes in your case, is not directly related to this issue, as it controls the duration of the user's session, whereas the transaction timeout controls the duration of a specific transactional operation.\n\nSteps:\nA.

If you are already on a compatible fix pack, ensure that your configuration is correct and the base entry matches the name in the repository. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to IBM support for further assistance.",
