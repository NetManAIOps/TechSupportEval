For example, you can set it to 3600000 (1 hour) to give the adapter more time to process the large order.\n* `siebel.conmgr.poolsize`: You can also increase the connection pool size to ensure that the adapter has more connections available to process the large order.\n\nHere's an example of what the `siebel.properties` file could look like:\n\n```\nsiebel.connection.string = siebel.tcpip.rsa.none://test.siebel.com/siebel/sseobjmgr_enu/test\nsiebel.conmgr.txtimeout = 3600000\nsiebel.conmgr.poolsize = 5\nsiebel.conmgr.sesstimeout = 300000\n```\n\nSave the `siebel.properties` file in the classpath of the adapter (e.g., `<adapter project>\\connectorModule`) and restart the adapter and broker to pick up the new settings. This should allow the adapter to process the large order without timing out.",

Check if the tablespace is enabled for reclaimable storage by running the following query:\n```sql\ndb2 \"SELECT varchar(tbsp_name, 30) as tbsp_name, tbsp_type, RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED \n     FROM TABLE(MON_GET_TABLESPACE('',-2))\"\n```\nIf the `RECLAIMABLE_SPACE_ENABLED` column is `NO`, it means the tablespace is not enabled for reclaimable storage.\n\n2.

The error message \"EJPPH0044E: Redeployment of Web Module id in WAR file did not complete successfully\" suggests that there is a problem with the WebSphere Application Server administration interface.\n\nTo resolve this issue, I would recommend checking the following:\n\n1. Ensure that the WebSphere Application Server administration interface is accessible and functioning correctly.\n2. Verify that the WAR file is correctly deployed and that the Web Module is properly configured.\n3. Check the configtrace.log file for any additional error messages or clues that may indicate the root cause of the issue.\n4. Consider checking the WebSphere Application Server logs for any errors related to the redeployment of the Web Module.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, I would recommend consulting the IBM Portal documentation and searching for any known issues or workarounds related to this specific error message.\n\nI don't have enough information to provide a more specific solution, but I hope this helps to get you started in troubleshooting the issue.",

The error message \"ORA-00942: table or view does not exist\" indicates that the script is trying to access a table or view that does not exist in your database.\n\nThe workaround provided in the context is to run the krzgrant.sql script in the 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-FP0001 package, which resolves this error.\n\nHowever, since you are using the 6.3.1.2-TIV-ITM_KRZ-IF0003.tar package, you can try the following steps to resolve the issue:\n\n1. Download the 6.3.1-TIV-ITM_KRZ-FP0001 package from the IBM Fix Central website.\n2. Extract the package and run the krzgrant.sql script from the extracted directory.\n3.

This means that if you have upgraded to a new release of CICS TS, you can still use CICS Explorer V5.4 to connect to CICS TS.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that upgrading to the latest release of CICS Explorer is recommended to obtain the most recent functionality and service. If you're experiencing issues with the current version of CICS Explorer, it's possible that upgrading to the latest release may resolve the issue.\n\nTo resolve the \"Unsupported CICS release\" error, you can try the following:\n\n1. Check the compatibility matrix for CICS Explorer and CICS TS to ensure that your current version of CICS Explorer is compatible with your CICS TS release.\n2. If you're using an older version of CICS Explorer, consider upgrading to the latest release to take advantage of the latest functionality and service.\n3.

I recommend checking the following:\n\n1. **Verify the firewall/proxy settings**: Ensure that the BigFix Server has access to sync.bigfix.com without any restrictions.\n2. **Disable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration**: If enabled, this might be blocking the download. Try disabling it on the BigFix Windows server machine.\n3. **Check the BESRelay.log and GatherDB.log files**: Review the logs for any additional error messages or clues that might indicate the cause of the issue.\n4. **Try accessing sync.bigfix.com directly**: Use a web browser to access sync.bigfix.com and verify that it's accessible.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, I'd like to investigate further. Can you please provide more information about the environment, such as the BigFix Server version, operating system, and any recent changes or updates?",

The problem is that the CQWEB login page cannot retrieve the repository dropdown list options.\n\nThe context suggests that the issue might be related to the database setup, specifically the registry structure. The error message \"Default DB path is not set\" indicates that the registry structure for database sets was not created successfully during the ClearQuest installation.\n\nTo resolve this issue, I would recommend the following steps:\n\n1.

This fix includes the update for APAR PI27904, which disables SSLv3 by default for IHS 7.0 and newer.\n2. Add the 'SSLProtocolEnable' directive to your IHS 7.0 configuration. This directive allows you to specify the protocols that the server will use for SSL/TLS connections. For example, you can add the following line to your configuration file:\n```\nSSLProtocolEnable TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2\n```\nThis will enable only TLS 1.1 and 1.2 protocols, and disable all other protocols, including SSLv3.\n\nNote: Make sure to restart the IHS server after making any changes to the configuration file.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to configure your server to only accept strong encryption protocols such as TLS 1.1.",

This defect causes SPSS to fail or close improperly, leading to issues with launching the software.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try deleting the following file on your Macintosh:\n\n`com.ibm.spss.plist`\n\nThis file is known to cause problems with the opening and closing of the Statistics software. Deleting it may help resolve the issue.\n\nAdditionally, since you've already tried reinstalling SPSS and updating Java, I would recommend checking the system requirements for SPSS on your Mac OS X version. According to the provided context, SPSS Statistics 22 is supported on Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion) and 10.8 (Mountain Lion) with Intel processor.

Rename and move the restricted JCE Policy files (`local_policy.jar` and `US_export_policy.jar`) from the `<ihsinst>/java/jre/lib/security/` directory to a directory that is outside the JDK class path, extdirs, or bootclasspath.\n2. Place the unrestricted JCE policy files (`local_policy.jar` and `US_export_policy.jar`) in the `<ihsinst>/java/jre/lib/security/` directory.\n3. Restart the ikeyman utility to pick up the unrestricted JCE policy files now located in the security directory.\n\nOnce you have completed these steps, you should be able to export the SSL key from the IBM HTTP Server 7 using the `gsk7cmd` command or the Ikeyman tool without encountering the restricted policy error.\n\nNote: Make sure to replace `<ihsinst>` with the actual path to your IBM HTTP Server installation directory.\n\nSteps:\nA.

          "context": "Based on the provided context, it seems that the issue is not directly related to creating batches for bulk upload in Datacap 9.0. However, I can provide some general guidance on how to create batches in Datacap.\n\nTo create batches for bulk upload, you can use the Batch Manager tool in Datacap Studio. Here's a high-level overview of the steps:\n\n1. Open Datacap Studio and navigate to the Batch Manager.\n2. Click on the \"Create Batch\" button.\n3. Select the document type (e.g., image or PDF) and the source location (e.g., the shared location where the client is sharing documents).\n4. Configure the batch settings, such as the batch name, description, and any additional parameters required for the batch.\n5. Click \"Create\" to create the batch.\n\nHowever, since you are new to Datacap 9.0, I recommend checking the Datacap documentation or online resources for more detailed instructions on using the Batch Manager tool.\n\nRegarding the specific issue of picking up all documents from a shared location, you may need to use a different tool or workflow in Datacap, such as a VScan task, which is a batch creation task that can be used to scan and process documents from a shared location.\n\nIf you could provide more information about the specific requirements and constraints of your project, I may be able to provide more tailored guidance.",

Clear the EventReader State: Run the ClearState.sh script using the JRExecAction function to clear the EventReader state. This script is mentioned in the provided code snippet.\n\nHere's a concise and actionable solution:\n\n**Resolution:**\n\n1. Identify the source of the future-dated StateChange value.\n2. Run the ClearState.sh script using the JRExecAction function:\n```bash\nJRExecAction(\"/opt/IBM/netcool/impact/bin/ClearState.sh\", \"password\", false, 30)\n```\nThis should clear the EventReader state and allow it to capture current events.
