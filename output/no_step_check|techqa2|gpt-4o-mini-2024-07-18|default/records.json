The error message indicates that the OMRPC request timed out after 600,133 ms.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you should increase the transaction timeout value in the Siebel connection settings. You can do this by creating a `siebel.properties` file and adding the following properties:\n\n* `siebel.conmgr.txtimeout`: Set this to a higher value in milliseconds to increase the transaction timeout. For example, you can set it to 3600000 (1 hour) to give the adapter more time to process the large order.\n* `siebel.conmgr.poolsize`: You can also increase the connection pool size to ensure that the adapter has more connections available to process the large order.\n\nHere's an example of what the `siebel.properties` file could look like:\n\n```\nsiebel.connection.string = siebel.tcpip.rsa.none://test.siebel.com/siebel/sseobjmgr_enu/test\nsiebel.conmgr.txtimeout = 3600000\nsiebel.conmgr.poolsize = 5\nsiebel.conmgr.sesstimeout = 300000\n```\n\nSave the `siebel.properties` file in the classpath of the adapter (e.g., `<adapter project>\\connectorModule`) and restart the adapter and broker to pick up the new settings.

The context provides information on deleting a document hierarchy node, such as a blank page, but it doesn't specifically address hiding a page based on its status.\n\nHowever, I can suggest a possible approach based on the information provided. You could create a custom action that uses the DeleteChildType action from the Validations library to remove the page with status 20. This would require creating a new page type, attaching it at the batch level, and then using the DeleteChildType action to remove the pages with that type.\n\nHere's a possible solution:\n\n1. Create a new page type, e.g., \"HideMe\", and attach it at the batch level.\n2. Use an action like \"BlankPagesIDBySize\" to identify the pages with status 20.\n3. Create a rule with the action \"DeleteChildType(HideMe)\" and attach it at the batch level to remove all pages with page type \"HideMe\".\n\nHowever, this solution assumes that you want to remove the pages with status 20 entirely, rather than just hiding them in dotedit. If you only want to hide them in dotedit, I'm not aware of a solution based on the provided context.",
