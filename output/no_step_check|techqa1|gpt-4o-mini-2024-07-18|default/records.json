To effectively exit the Policy process from within a UDF, you need to set a global variable that indicates the exit condition and then check that variable immediately after the UDF call.\n\nHere’s how you can implement this:\n\n1.

Here are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Check Server Level Settings**:\n   - Navigate to **Servers > Application Servers > Your Server > Web Container > Session Management**.\n   - Ensure that the session timeout is set to a value greater than 30 minutes. If you want to disable the timeout, select \"No time-out\".\n\n2. **Check Enterprise Application Level Settings**:\n   - Go to **Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Session Management**.\n   - Ensure that \"Override\" is checked and set the timeout value to greater than 30 minutes.\n\n3. **Check Web Application Level Settings**:\n   - Navigate to **Applications > Enterprise Applications > Your Application > Web Module > Your Web App.war > Session Management**.\n   - Again, ensure \"Override\" is checked and set a timeout value greater than 30 minutes.\n\n4. **Check Application Code**:\n   - If applicable, review the application code to see if the session timeout is being set using the `setMaxInactiveInterval()` method on the `HttpSession` object. Ensure this value is also greater than 30 minutes.\n\n5. **Save Configuration**:\n   - After making any changes, ensure you save the master configuration and restart the server if necessary for the changes to take effect.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the session timeout issue. If the problem persists, consider checking for any additional configurations or settings that may be overriding your session timeout values.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Check Override in the <BLANK 1> section\n\n2. Select to set the time-out and the time-out value\n   This sets the application session to overwrite those values set at the parent, which in this case is the Server level.\n\nOutput format:\nProvide the answer as a JSON object with the key \"answer\", which contains a list of objects.

This includes:\n   - SystemOut.log file located at `install_root/profiles/profile_name/logs/server_name`.\n   - Any error messages or codes that appeared around the time the issue occurred.\n\n2. **Use MustGather Documentation**: Refer to the MustGather documentation specific to your BPM version to ensure you collect all necessary data. This will expedite the troubleshooting process.\n\n3. **Utilize IBM Support Resources**:\n   - Use the [IBM Support Assistant](http://www.ibm.com/software/support/isa/) to search for known problems and solutions.\n   - Check the [IBM dW Answers](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/bpm/) and developerWorks community for similar issues and resolutions.\n\n4. **Search for Fixes**: If you identify a potential fix, search [Fix Central](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/) for interim fixes that may apply to your situation.\n\n5. **Document Your Findings**: Keep a record of the symptoms, steps taken, and any relevant logs or configuration changes. This information will be valuable when communicating with the support team.\n\nBy following these steps, you can provide the BPM support team with the information they need to assist you effectively.",

This can lead to the database using outdated routines, which results in the error.\n\nTo resolve this issue, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check the Current Version**: Run the following command on your monitored database to check the version number:\n   ```\n   db2 \"select versionnumber from sysibm.sysversions order by 1 desc\"\n   ```\n   Ensure that the version number matches the DB2 level supported by DSM.\n\n2. **Update the Database**: If the version number is lower than expected, you need to update the database system catalog. Use the appropriate `db2updvnn` command based on your DB2 version:\n   - For DB2 V9.7: `db2updv97`\n   - For DB2 V10.1: `db2updv10`\n   - For DB2 V10.5: `db2updv105`\n   - For DB2 V11.1: `db2updv111`\n\n   You can find more details on how to run these commands in the IBM documentation linked in the context.\n\n3. **Verify the Update**: After running the update command, check the version again using the first command to ensure it reflects the correct level.\n\n4. **Restart DSM**: Once the database is updated, restart the IBM Data Server Manager to see if the errors persist.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the SQLCODE=-206 errors in your DSM error log.",

If the information is not available in the text, respond with \"Unanswerable.\"\n\nText:\nThe error message \"Table . could not be found in the database\" when performing table mapping with DB2 is likely due to the presence of special characters in the column comments that are not being handled correctly. Here are the steps you can take to resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Check for Invalid Characters**: Ensure that the column comments do not contain invalid UTF-8 characters. You can use a hex editor to verify the encoding of the characters in the comments.\n\n2. **Delete Invalid Rows**: If you find rows with incorrect Unicode codepoints, delete them from the table using:\n   ```sql\n   DELETE FROM your_table_name WHERE your_condition;\n   ```\n\n3. **Set Correct Locale**: Make sure your operating system locale matches the codepage of the data you are working with. You can set the locale to UTF-8 by running:\n   ```bash\n   export LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n   export LC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\n   ```\n\n4. **Create Database with UTF-8**: If you haven't already, create a database that uses UTF-8 encoding:\n   ```sql\n   CREATE DATABASE your_db_name USING CODESET utf-8 TERRITORY US;\n   ```\n\n5. **Insert Data with Correct Encoding**: When inserting data, ensure that the data is in UTF-8 format. If you are using a command line processor (CLP), ensure that the data being inserted is also UTF-8 encoded. You can insert data like this:\n   ```sql\n   INSERT INTO your_table_name (column_name) VALUES ('Ã'), ('³'), ('©');\n   ```\n\n6. **Verify Inserted Data**: After inserting, verify that the data has been correctly converted to UTF-8 by running:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT column_name, HEX(column_name) FROM your_table_name;\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with the table mapping and avoid the error regarding the table not being found.
