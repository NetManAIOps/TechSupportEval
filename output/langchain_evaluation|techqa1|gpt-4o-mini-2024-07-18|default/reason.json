This means that the Exit() function behaves differently when called from within a UDF compared to when it is called directly in the Policy.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Submission**: The submission correctly states that the Exit() action function within a UDF does not exit the entire Policy process, but only exits the UDF itself. This aligns with the input provided.\n\n3. **Proposed Solution**: The submission then provides a method to exit the Policy process from within a UDF by using a global variable. It suggests setting a global variable to indicate the exit condition and checking that variable immediately after the UDF call. This is a logical approach to control the flow of the Policy based on conditions set within the UDF.\n\n4. **Implementation Details**: The submission includes code snippets that demonstrate how to set the global variable and check it after the UDF call. This is consistent with the reference provided, which states to set a variable that is then tested immediately after the User Defined Function call.\n\n5. **Correctness of the Code**: The code snippets provided in the submission appear to be syntactically correct and logically sound.
