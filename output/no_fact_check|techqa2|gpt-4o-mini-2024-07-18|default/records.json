The error message \"The transaction is no longer active - status: 'Marked rollback.

Specifically, you can modify the value of the property \"ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout\" to a higher value, such as 1200 seconds (20 minutes).\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. Locate the web.xml file in the RTS/DC EAR file (jrules-teamserver-<appserver>.ear\\teamserver.war\\WEB-INF).\n2. Find the property \"ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout\" and modify its value to a higher value, such as 1200.\n3. Save the changes to the web.xml file.\n\nNote that you may need to restart the TeamServer application after making these changes.\n\nIt's worth noting that the session timeout is set to 30 minutes by default, but it's unlikely to be the cause of the issue in this case, as the error message specifically mentions a transaction timeout.\n\nSteps:\nA.

Create a temporary directory to store the backup files:\n```\nmkdir /tmp/restore\n```\n2. Use `nco_sql` to restore the backup:\n```\n./nco_sql -server NCOMS -restore /tmp/backup\n```\nNote: The `-restore` option is not explicitly mentioned in the context, but it is a common option used in `nco_sql` to restore a backup.\n\n3. Verify that the restore process is complete and the database is in a healthy state.\n\nPlease note that I'm assuming the backup files are in the `/tmp/backup` directory, which was created earlier. If the backup files are in a different location, you will need to modify the command accordingly.\n\nAlso, please ensure that you have the necessary permissions and access to the ObjectServer database and the backup files.\n\nIf you have any further questions or issues, please let me know.",

The solution provided in the context, which involves restarting the Dmgr and re-running the installation, may also be applicable to this issue.\n\nTherefore, my suggested solution is:\n\n1. Ensure the Dmgr is running on the node.\n2. Verify the vertical cluster members are properly configured.\n3. Check the ConfigTrace.log for any other errors or warnings.\n4. Review the installation instructions for CF09 and ensure all prerequisites and dependencies are met.\n5.

For example, you can use a simple implementation like this:\n```java\nif (serverName.equals(\"testingServer1\")) {\n    return new URL(\"http://server1:9000/testing\");\n} else if (serverName.equals(\"testingServer2\")) {\n    return new URL(\"http://server2:9000/testing\");\n} else {\n    return new URL(\"http://host1:9000/testing\");\n}\n```\nThis implementation returns a specific server URL based on the server name.\n\n3. In the Decision Center configuration, make sure to specify the custom `IlrSSPResolver` class in the `sspResolver` property. For example:\n```xml\n<sspResolver class=\"com.example.MySSPResolver\"/>\n```\nReplace `com.example.MySSPResolver` with the actual package and class name of your custom `IlrSSPResolver` implementation.\n\nBy following these steps, Decision Center should now look for the SSP on the specified server URL based on the server name.\n\nNote: Make sure to deploy the SSP (ssp.war) on each server along with a XU connection factory and the appropriate datasource definition, as mentioned in the provided context.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Implement the method <BLANK 1>.\n\n2. Create your own SSP resolver and add it to the <BLANK 2> file and set the teamserver.defaultSSPResolver.class property to this class.\n\n3. Deploy the SSP on each server.\n   Ensure that the ssp.war is deployed on each server along with a <BLANK 3> connection factory and the appropriate datasource definition.\n\nOutput format:\nProvide the answer as a JSON object with the key \"answer\", which contains a list of objects. Each object should include:\n- \"blank\": The blank ID (e.g., 1, 2, 3).\n- \"content\": The corresponding content for the blank.\nIf the blank cannot be filled based on the provided text, the \"content\" field should be \"Unanswerable\".\n\nExample:\n{\n    \"answer\": [\n        {\"blank\": 1, \"content\": \"xxx\"}\n    ]\n}\n\n**IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format.

Create a custom `IlrSSPResolver` class that implements the `IlrSSPResolver` interface.\n2. In the `getSSPURL` method, use the `serverName` parameter to determine which server URL to return.

However, I can provide some general guidance on how to create batches in Datacap.\n\nTo create batches for bulk upload, you can use the Batch Manager tool in Datacap Studio. Here's a high-level overview of the steps:\n\n1. Open Datacap Studio and navigate to the Batch Manager.\n2. Click on the \"Create Batch\" button.\n3. Select the document type (e.g., image or PDF) and the source location (e.g., the shared location where the client is sharing documents).\n4. Configure the batch settings, such as the batch name, description, and any additional parameters required for the batch.\n5. Click \"Create\" to create the batch.\n\nHowever, since you are new to Datacap 9.0, I recommend checking the Datacap documentation or online resources for more detailed instructions on using the Batch Manager tool.\n\nRegarding the specific issue of picking up all documents from a shared location, you may need to use a different tool or workflow in Datacap, such as a VScan task, which is a batch creation task that can be used to scan and process documents from a shared location.\n\nIf you could provide more information about the specific requirements and constraints of your project, I may be able to provide more tailored guidance.",

If the issue persists, try restarting the license server by clicking on Start > IBM Rational > LMTools > Start/Stop/Reread tab.\n4. Finally, try re-configuring the floating license support for Rational Integration Tester in IM by following the steps in the TECHNOTE document.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, I would recommend checking the IBM Rational License Key Center website for any updates or patches related to the license server or IM.
