However, be cautious when adjusting these settings, as increasing timeouts can impact system performance. Monitor your system's behavior after making these changes to ensure they have the desired effect.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Create a <BLANK 1> file and save it in the <BLANK 2> of the adapter.\n\n2.

The default transaction timeout is 10 minutes (600 seconds), which is set in the `web.xml` file of the TeamServer EAR file. If the transactional operation takes longer than this timeout to complete, the transaction is rolled back and the operation is not completed, resulting in the user being kicked out.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can try increasing the transaction timeout value in the `web.xml` file by changing the value of the `ilog.rules.teamserver.transaction.timeout` property. For example, you can increase the value to 1200 seconds (20 minutes) or more, depending on the complexity of the operations being performed.\n\nAdditionally, you should also check the application server-specific transaction timeout configurations, such as the \"Maximum transaction timeout\" in WebSphere Application Server, and increase it as needed.\n\nIt's worth noting that the session timeout, which is set to 30 minutes in your case, is not directly related to this issue, as it controls the duration of the user's session, whereas the transaction timeout controls the duration of a specific transactional operation.\n\nSteps:\nA.

This is a result of the CVE-2014-3075 vulnerability fix, which aims to prevent potentially malicious files from being uploaded and executed.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you need to explicitly add the `text/html` MIME type to the `100Custom.xml` file to override the default configuration. This will allow HTML documents to be rendered correctly again.\n\nHere's an example of how to configure the `100Custom.xml` file:\n```xml\n<document-attachment-download-mime-types>\n  <!-- will map text/html mime type to text/html mime type -->\n  <mime-type-map>\n    <from>text/html</from>\n    <to>text/html</to>\n  </mime-type-map>\n</document-attachment-download-mime-types>\n```\nBy adding this configuration, you're allowing HTML documents to be rendered correctly, while still maintaining the security benefits of the vulnerability fix.",

If the information is not available in the text, respond with \"Unanswerable.\"\n\nText:\nTo fix the error CRIMA1217E when upgrading JAZZ from 1.1.0 to 1.1.3 failed, you need to use the provided script `JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh` to initiate the upgrade process. This script gives the non-root user the correct permissions for the upgrade.\n\nFor silent installation, use the following command with three arguments:\n```\n./JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh \"IM_Install_Location\" \"JazzSM_Install_Location\" \"Response_file_with_absolute_Path\"\n```\nFor example:\n```\n./JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh \"/home/root/IBM/InstallManager/\" \"/opt/IBM/JazzSM/\" \"/opt/Download/dash_upgrade_rsp.xml\"\n```\nFor GUI mode installation, use the following command with two arguments:\n```\n./JazzSMgrpModeUpgrade.sh \"IM_Install_Location\" \"JazzSM_Install_Location\"\n```\nThis will invoke Installation Manager in GUI mode and lead you through the rest of the upgrade process.\n\nNote: Replace the `IM_Install_Location`, `JazzSM_Install_Location`, and `Response_file_with_absolute_Path` with your actual installation paths and response file.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Use the attached script to initiate the upgrade.\n   This script is necessary to give the <BLANK 1> user (who originally installed this Jazz for Service Management instance) the correct permissions for the upgrade process. Usage: <BLANK 2>\n\nOutput format:\nProvide the answer as a JSON object with the key \"answer\", which contains a list of objects. Each object should include:\n- \"blank\": The blank ID (e.g., 1, 2, 3).\n- \"content\": The corresponding content for the blank.\nIf the blank cannot be filled based on the provided text, the \"content\" field should be \"Unanswerable\".\n\nExample:\n{\n    \"answer\": [\n        {\"blank\": 1, \"content\": \"xxx\"}\n    ]\n}\n\n**IMPORTANT: Please make sure to only return in JSON format. No words or explanation is needed.**\n\nOutput:\n",
