This property increases the file size limit to handle large character lengths for the `USERPARAMETERS` parameter.\n\nHere are the steps to follow:\n\n1. **Identify the required file size limit**: Determine the appropriate size limit (e.g., 8192, 16384, 32768, etc.) based on the length of your `USERPARAMETERS` property, including the property name and definition.\n\n2. **Add the property to the configuration files**: On each ImpactServer in the Cluster, open the `<SERVERNAME>_server.props` file located in `$NCHOME/impact/etc/` and add the following line, replacing `<size>` with your chosen size limit:\n   ```\n   nci.type.file.size.limit=<size>\n   ```\n   Ensure there are no trailing white-space characters, as they can invalidate properties in lower versions of Impact.\n\n3. **Restart the ImpactServers**: After adding the property to all servers, restart each ImpactServer to enable the new configuration. It's crucial that the ImpactServer started as Primary has the correct, uncorrupted `.type` file to be replicated across the Cluster.\n\n4. **Verify the resolution**: After restarting, check the `.type` file on the Secondary ImpactServer to ensure it is no longer truncated and that the DataType is correctly replicated.\n\nThis solution applies to all versions of Netcool/Impact, although the specific APAR (IZ81446) mentioned is not an issue in Impact 6 and 7. However, adding the property is still necessary to handle large character lengths for the `USERPARAMETERS` parameter in those versions.\n\nQuestion:\n1.

Ensure you select the correct version based on your Java SR version.\n\n3. **Rename and Move Restricted Policy Files**: Move the restricted policy files (`local_policy.jar` and `US_export_policy.jar`) from the `<ihsinst>/java/jre/lib/security/` directory to a location outside the JDK class path, extdirs, or bootclasspath.\n\n4. **Install Unrestricted Policy Files**: Place the downloaded unrestricted JCE policy files (`local_policy.jar` and `US_export_policy.jar`) in the `<ihsinst>/java/jre/lib/security/` directory.\n\n5. **Restart ikeyman Utility**: After replacing the policy files, restart the ikeyman utility. This should allow you to export your SSL key to PKCS12 format without encountering the restricted policy error.\n\nAlternatively, you can also resolve the issue by downloading and installing a later Java 32-bit x86 AMD/Intel Java SDK from the [WebSphere Support web site](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?rs=180&uid=swg24023707) to the IBM HTTP Server java and plug-ins java folder.\n\nAfter completing these steps, you should be able to successfully export your key to a PKCS12 file using the command:\n```bash\n/usr/IBM/HTTPServer/bin/gsk7cmd -cert -export -db /usr/IBM/HTTPServer/ssl/key.kdb -pw #### -label \"domain1\" -type cms -target /tmp/domain1.p12 -target_type PKCS12 -target_pw ####\n```",

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Create a custom SSP resolver class**: Implement the `IlrSSPResolver` interface and override the `getSSPURL(String serverName, URL url)` method. This method should return the URL of the SSP server based on the server name.\n2. **Add the custom SSP resolver to the teamserver.war**: Package the custom SSP resolver class into the teamserver.war file.\n3. **Set the teamserver.defaultSSPResolver.class property**: Configure the `teamserver.defaultSSPResolver.class` property to point to your custom SSP resolver class.\n4. **Define multiple servers in RTS**: Define multiple servers in Rule Team Server (RTS) with different URLs, such as `testingServer1` and `testingServer2`.\n5. **Implement the getSSPURL method**: In the `getSSPURL` method, use the server name to return the specific SSP URL. For example:\n```java\nif (serverName.equals(\"testingServer1\")) {\n    return new URL(\"http://server1:9000/testing\");\n} else if (serverName.equals(\"testingServer2\")) {\n    return new URL(\"http://server2:9000/testing\");\n} else {\n    return new URL(\"http://defaultServer:9000/testing\");\n}\n```\nBy following these steps, you can configure Decision Center to look for the SSP on a different App server based on the server name.\n\nNote: Make sure to deploy the SSP (ssp.war) on each server along with a XU connection factory and the appropriate datasource definition, as mentioned in the context.",

If the information is not available in the text, respond with \"Unanswerable.\"\n\nText:\nTo resolve the issue of images not being displayed in PDF/Excel outputs in Cognos Analytics 11.0.3, while they are visible in HTML format, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Folder Permissions**: Ensure that the folder containing the images has the correct permissions configured. Enable anonymous access in IIS 7.5 for the root folder of your Cognos installation, the image folder, and its parent folder.\n\n2. **Verify Image Location**: Confirm that the images are located in the directory specified in the report settings. If the images are not in the specified location, move them to the correct directory.\n\n3. **Use Process Monitor for Diagnosis**: If the issue persists, use the Process Monitor tool to diagnose the problem. \n   - Download and run Process Monitor from the same machine where Cognos is installed.\n   - Open the report in Cognos Workspace.\n   - Start capturing events in Process Monitor.\n   - Export the report to Excel 2007 or PDF.\n   - Stop the capture and filter the events to find the image name to identify the reason for the failure under the 'Result' column.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue preventing images from being displayed in PDF and Excel outputs in Cognos Analytics.\n\nQuestion:\n1. Open up IIS <BLANK 1>\n   \n2. Click on the root folder of your Cognos installation (E.g. C1021GA) in the navigation pane on the left side\n   \n3.
