The explanation of the output is also included, stating that \"Table not logged : 1\" indicates the table was created as NOT LOGGED INITIALLY, while \"Table not logged : 0\" indicates it was not.\n   - **Using db2look**: The command `db2look -d <database_name> -t <table_name> -e -o <output_file_name.out>` is mentioned, with the explanation that it generates a DDL statement that will include the \"NOT LOGGED INITIALLY\" clause if applicable.\n\n3. **Cross-Referencing with the Reference**: \n   - The first method using `db2cat` is consistent with the reference. The command and the interpretation of the output match exactly.\n   - The second method using `db2look` is also relevant, as it provides a way to see the DDL statement, which would indicate if the table was created with the NOT LOGGED INITIALLY clause.\n\n4. **Additional Notes in the Submission**: The submission includes a note that these methods will not detect if a table was altered with ACTIVATE NOT LOGGED INITIALLY, which is a relevant point. It also mentions that in DB2 V9 and later, the LOG_ATTRIBUTE column in the SYSCAT.TABLES table is no longer used, which is factual and adds context.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The submission accurately describes the methods to determine if a table was created as NOT LOGGED INITIALLY, aligns with the reference provided, and includes additional relevant information. Therefore, it meets the criteria of correctness.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the submission meets the criteria.\n\nY"

The user is inquiring whether the ITCAM for MQ monitoring agent (kmq) is responsible for this event and is looking for guidance on identifying the application causing the issue.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Submission**: The submission states that the context does not explicitly confirm whether the ITCAM for MQ monitoring agent uses the SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE. This is accurate because the input does not provide definitive information linking the agent to the queue.\n\n3. **Providing a Solution**: The submission suggests using the `display conn(*) where(objname eq SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE) all` command under runmqsc to identify the process ID and application name associated with the queue. This is a correct and relevant suggestion, as it aligns with the goal of determining which application is causing the 2085 event.\n\n4. **Linking to the ITCAM Agent**: The submission correctly notes that if the APPLTAG field in the output matches the ITCAM for MQ monitoring agent, it would indicate that the agent is using the queue. This is a logical conclusion based on the command's output.\n\n5. **Conclusion on Certainty**: The submission concludes that without explicit information linking the ITCAM for MQ monitoring agent to the SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE, the cause of the 2085 event remains uncertain. This is a reasonable and factual statement, as the input does not provide such explicit information.\n\n6. **Reference Check**: The reference provided confirms the command to be used, which is consistent with the submission's suggestion.

The error message in the log file suggests that the uninstall process requires explicit agreement to the license terms.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Submission**: The submission claims that the issue is due to an incomplete path to the silent response file (MQ_Silent_Uninstall.txt) not being specified in the command. It suggests providing a complete path to the silent response file in the command to resolve the issue.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Correctness of the Submission**: \n   - The submission correctly identifies that the command needs a complete path to the silent response file. However, the original input does not indicate that the path was incomplete; it only states that the uninstall fails despite the presence of the necessary line in the response file.\n   - The submission does not address the actual problem, which is that the uninstall process is failing because it requires agreement to the license, not because of an incomplete path. The line in the response file indicates that the agreement is present, but the uninstall process is still failing, suggesting that the response file may not be read correctly or that there is another underlying issue.\n\n4. **Reference Check**: The reference states to specify the complete path to the silent response file while launching the silent install. While this is a valid point, it does not directly address the core issue of the license agreement not being acknowledged during the uninstall process.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: The submission does not accurately diagnose the problem as it misinterprets the cause of the failure.
