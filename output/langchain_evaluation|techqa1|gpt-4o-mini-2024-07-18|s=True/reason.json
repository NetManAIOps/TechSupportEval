The user is trying to determine if the ITCAM for MQ monitoring agent (kmq) is responsible for this event and is looking for guidance on identifying the application causing the issue.\n\n2. **Evaluating the Submission**: The submission states that the ITCAM for MQ monitoring agent does not specifically mention the use of the `SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE` in relation to the 2085 event. This aligns with the input, as the user noted that the technote does not mention Tivoli monitoring products.\n\n3. **Analysis of the Cause of the 2085 Event**: The submission correctly identifies that the 2085 event may occur when an application attempts to access a queue that does not exist or is unavailable. This is a factual statement and aligns with the general understanding of MQ error codes.\n\n4. **Providing a Solution**: The submission suggests using the `runmqsc` command to check for connections to the queue manager, specifically mentioning a command to display connections to the `SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE`. However, the command provided in the submission is slightly incorrect. The correct command format, as referenced, is `display conn(*) where(objname eq Q1) all`, where `Q1` should be replaced with the actual queue name. The submission does not specify that `SYSTEM.MQXR.COMMAND.QUEUE` should replace `Q1`, which could lead to confusion.\n\n5. **Conclusion on Correctness**: While the submission provides a generally accurate assessment of the situation and offers a method to investigate the issue, the slight inaccuracy in the command format detracts from its overall correctness. The submission does not fully meet the criteria of being correct, accurate, and factual due to this oversight.\n\nBased on this analysis, the submission does not meet the criteria for correctness.\n\nN"
