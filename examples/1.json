    "question": "User environment variables no longer getting picked up after upgrade to 4.1.1.1 or 4.1.1.2?\nHave you found that after upgrade to Streams 4.1.1.1 or 4.1.1.2, that environment variables set in your .bashrc are no longer being set? For example ODBCINI is not set for the database toolkit and you get\n\n     An SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code\n     is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver\n     Manager]Connnection does not exist.",
    "ground_truth": "1. Set environment variables that are needed by the application directly in the instance.\n   Use the command **streamtool setproperty** followed by the parameters '-d <domain> -i <instance>' and '--application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>' to configure the environment variables.",
    "answer": "After upgrading to Streams 4.1.1.1 or 4.1.1.2, environment variables set in your .bashrc are not being picked up when Streams is run as a system service. To resolve this issue, you need to set the required environment variables directly in the Streams instance using the `streamtool` command.\n\nHereâ€™s how to do it:\n\n1. Open your terminal.\n2. Use the following command to set the environment variable:\n\n   ```\n   streamtool setproperty -d <domain> -i <instance> --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<domain>` with your domain name, `<instance>` with your instance name, `<VARIABLE NAME>` with the name of the environment variable (e.g., ODBCINI), and `<VARIABLE VALUE>` with the value you want to set.\n\nFor example, if you want to set the ODBCINI variable, the command would look like this:\n\n```\nstreamtool setproperty -d myDomain -i myInstance --application-ev ODBCINI=/path/to/odbc.ini\n```\n\nThis should resolve the issue with the environment variables not being recognized."
